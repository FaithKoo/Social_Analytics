Convenient location, slightly pricy school feels (but hey you are sitting on prime real estate surrounded by many shopping malls), good cheap food nearby and there is definitely time for CCA & non-academic pursuits. But there's one thing on my chest that I want to inform all prospective students considering admission into SMU - the Grade Point Average system (GPA)  \n\n\nSome background info: NUS and NTU adopts the CAP system when it comes to awarding the grade points for the grade you obtain for any gradable module. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nA 5.0/5.0 \n\nA- 4.5/5.0\n\nB+ 4.0/5.0\n\nB 3.5/5.0 \n\nand so on. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis cumulates after every semester. So if you take a 5-module semester and you score 4B+ and 1B, your CAP for that semester is \\[(4x4.00)+(1x3.5)/5\\] = 3.90. SMU on the other hand adopts the American GPA system and the points for each grade are as follow.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA 4.0/4.0 \n\nA- 3.7/4.0\n\nB+ 3.3/4.0\n\nB 3.0/4.0 \n\nand so on. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt cumulates after every semester too. So taking the same grades as the above, your GPA would be \\[(4x3.30)+(1x3.00)/5\\] = 3.24\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere's the tricky part. In NUS and NTU, scoring a 4.5/5.0 & above gets you a first class honours. 4.00/5.00 - 4.49/5.00 second class honours (upper). 3.50 - 3.99 second class honours (lower). In SMU, scoring a 3.80/4.00 & above gets you a Suma Cum Laude. 3.60 - 3.79 Magna Cum Laude, 3.40 - 3.59 Cum Laude and 3.20-3.39 High Merit (there's other terms for GPA below 3.20). And for SMU, a Cum Laude is equivalent of an Honours. So, imagine a student with all B+ graduates from NUS and NTU. He/she obtains a second class honours (upper) with a CAP of 4.0/5.0. But a student from SMU obtains a high merit with a GPA of 3.3/4.0. No honours.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI feel that this unfairly disadvantages SMU graduates when it comes to applying for internships or full time jobs, especially in the public sector where sometimes having an honours degree gets you a higher starting salary as compared to a degree with no honours. I must state that grades are not everything. If you are capable/if you possess the desired skills/if you have good networks and if you pass your interview, getting your internships or jobs shouldn't be a problem. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHOWEVER, there are many MNCs, banks and organizations that explicitly state on their graduate hiring page that they are looking for graduates with a good honours degree. Some, like a prominent real estate organization even explicitly wrote for their graduate position that they are looking for graduates with a \"Second Class Upper/Magna Cum Laude or equivalent\". Since Magna Cum Laude is behind Suma Cum Laude, they associate Magna Cum Laude as an equivalent to a Second Class Upper. A particularly bank even listed high merit as third class!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTherefore, if you are A student, good for you. You don't have to worry, but if you are B or a B+ student, I would say you are much better off at NUS or NTU! To me, i think that the undergraduate modules in SMU are around the same difficulty as NUS or NTU (if anyone has done a local exchange, please let us know how you find the modules if both schools). I really don't see why an SMU B+ is worth less than a B+ elsewhere. Seems like some B+ are more equal than others. The issue to me lies in how the grade points are awarded to the grade. The gap between an A- 3.70 and B+ 3.30 is too wide, especially when a Cum Laude (Honours equivalent) is 3.40 and above. I feel that it would be more fair if SMU adjusts their B+ to 3.40\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;"], ["suicide_aunties", "That\u2019s a really formal-sounding post.
