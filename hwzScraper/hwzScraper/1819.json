(For NUS bidding system) Assuming you're a freshman, did you get an email detailing important information for incoming students? This should've included a thorough explanation of the CORS system and how to bid. From what I can paraphrase, who 'wins' a placement depends on two things: Number of points and Time of bid, level of importance respective to order of mention.  For a simplified example, imagine a module with only 3 vacant spots and 4 bidders. The points bid are 120, 100, 90 and 50. Since there's only 3 spots, the lowest fourth bidder loses out. Now, an alternate scenario can play out instead. What if the points were 120, 100, 90 and 90? The system cannot choose the final third bidder on points alone, because they've got the same number. This is where timing comes in- the bidder who put in their points earlier will emerge victorious against another bidder who put in the same amount, but at a later timing. Hope this helps!"},

I\u2019m not gonna stay in hall and I\u2019m going to NUS business too. And the main reason being I feel like Hall activities will take me away from other enriching activities like business case competitions, overseas exchange and internships (subjective becaus it\u2019s my personal opinion) and I have friends who think like me too and are not gonna stay in Hall. So tho I may not have \u201cHall friends\u201d, I plan to make a group of true friends that I can study and play tgt w like sign up for IFG etc tgt. So, it really depends on how u wanna look at it. At the end of the day, uni life is yours to make. And i do agree with you that the selection criteria is utter bull, and it\u2019s their fault for being so myopic. But I also feel like while their immaturity will affect us freshmen, we shouldn\u2019t let them affect us. Instead, we should strive to be better than them! Like next year, go be an OGL!

I haven't got into the system yet so can't do anything  if they don't do anything , we can always post on EDMW and make it known to everybody. sex camp still exist as it didn't gain public attention previously, I'm sure discriminatory admission to orientation camp would gain some hype too if we make it public"},

However, I downgraded to E1L9 even before I enlisted, so deferred until finally enlisted on 20 Aug 2013. My ORD date was 19 Aug 2015, but I disrupted on 31 July 2015, a Friday. To enter NUS.

{"name": "cold_porkcutlet", "message": "Hi guys, this is just to add to the thread for those who are still waiting or have been rejected and waiting for another chance next year: I'm from polytechnic, and graduated with a final GPA of 3.34. I was rejected last year during the 2017-2018 intake, and tried again this year.  My choices stated for NTU is as follows: 1. English Lit  2. English Lit and Art History 3. Sociology 4. Philosophy 5. History  Initially I thought there was no hope, since I actually failed during the initial application round, and also failed the appeal round when we all have to write that dreaded 200 word long essay that explains why we deserve a place etc.  However, on 3 July, I received an e-mail from the School of Humanities (History) that basically informed me if I was still interested in studying for a History degree instead, and if I did, that I should write in an appeal essay ASAP (Bear in mind, this is when appeal period has already ended around end May). Being someone who has always been interested in the area of the Arts, I took up the offer immediately.  What I had to do was to draft up another version of said appeal essay, send it to Admissions and wait for a reply. The reply came eventually and so did the interview. And right now, I'm just waiting to matriculate officially etc. So this is just to relay hope to the rest that's waiting. If it doesn't work for you this year, there's always a chance next year. You just have to tell yourself to just hold on. Just hold on, and things will get better ^^!P.S. I can't send PM's for some reason so to the one who was curious about what questions were asked during the interview, the questions include: 1. Why NTU History and not NUS History? 2. Why do you want to take/study this course?  3. What was the most stressful event that you've experienced and how did you overcome it OR what advice would you give when it comes to handling extreme stress? 4. Do you have any questions for me? (Your chance to pose questions to the interviewer of course.) "},

{"name": "No use for a Name", "message": "Nicholas92 wrote:  Go for it if you can! Is it still free these days? I feel that this program is one of best initiatives the school had. A bit of history if you're wondering why got this program: Since donkey years ago, NBS indicated that \"polytechnic candidates with additional mathematics are preferred\" for admission. But on case by case basis through interviews, the school did accept students without. As you might guess, polytechnic entrants w/o add.maths tend to fare poorly compared to their JC peers on certain quantitative modules, most notably the year 1 statistics module. In 2011 & 2012, the school introduced a mathematics test for these group of students. In my opinion, that wasn't the best idea. Why bother giving a maths test to people you know don't have background.  They must have gotten the message, and scrapped it in 2013, replacing it with this preparatory course. That this program is still being conducted in 2018, I think it's safe to take it that your seniors from 2013 - 2017 have shown improved results.  PS: I found my current girlfriend from this class.

I feel that this program is one of best initiatives the school had. A bit of history if you're wondering why got this program: Since donkey years ago, NBS indicated that \"polytechnic candidates with additional mathematics are preferred\" for admission. But on case by case basis through interviews, the school did accept students without. As you might guess, polytechnic entrants w/o add.maths tend to fare poorly compared to their JC peers on certain quantitative modules, most notably the year 1 statistics module. In 2011 & 2012, the school introduced a mathematics test for these group of students. In my opinion, that wasn't the best idea. Why bother giving a maths test to people you know don't have background.  They must have gotten the message, and scrapped it in 2013, replacing it with this preparatory course. That this program is still being conducted in 2018, I think it's safe to take it that your seniors from 2013 - 2017 have shown improved results.  PS: I found my current girlfriend from this class.

I did my O levels and FLUNKED it scoring a total of 33 points for my L1R5 and not even ITE wanted to touch me  I went to serve my NS and worked a few years before deciding not to retake my O levels and do my A levels as a private candidate taking private classes over the span of 16 months. So the only similarity I have to a JC kid is that I did A levels. The typical JC kid certainly wasn't working full-time while juggling A levels with ZERO background as a private candidate and having been out of the education system for a decade To get back onto the point, I've seen my fair share of achievers being poly students and fair share of underachievers who also happen to be poly students. Unless you have statistical proof to back up your claim that poly kids tend to do better, it's just generalizing at this point. Same with SUSS/SIM kids claiming to be more \"street-smart\" than NUS/NTU/SMU students even though I've yet to see any proof beyond \"uncle/auntie/mother/father said so\"  I suggest if you want to argue a point, argue it and not make a total ass of yourself making some very inaccurate assumptions that's so far off it made my day to deconstruct  Edit: Also to add, group work components doesn't even form a significant part of your grade. While it can definitely help your grade, unless you did horribly for it, you can get an average grade for group work component and still score an A if you do well for finals."},

Full-time undergraduates who : Have taken or are taking up one or more of the following schemes:  Tuition Fee Loan and/or CPF Education Scheme and/or Mendaki Tertiary Tuition Fee Subsidy/Loan. Scholarship recipients who are interested in taking up this loan to finance part of their fees and/or their living expenses may drop an email to finaid@ntu.edu.sg for consideration.The above loans/subsidies must cover at least 90% of the subsidised tuition fees paid by a Singaporean student. May I just apply for the Study Loan without taking up the other loans? No, you cannot apply for this loan if you are not interested in taking up any of the loans covered in point 1 above. So if you're like me who arent applying for CPF education scheme or by Mendaki, you need to apply for tuition fee loan to take up the study loan. Yes, like what you have mentioned. In general, study loans are the 'last option' with prerequisites to meet. P.s. Anyway CPF Education scheme would have already fully covered the tuition fees while Tuition Fee loan covers up to 90%. Perhaps working part-time would be sufficient to cover one's living expense "},

Well these are the outliers that belong to the bottom 10 percentile listed in the IGP list. I\u2019m pretty sure majority of these cases were made for people who appealed. From my experience, they don\u2019t look so much at your grades for appeals, but rather you as a person (achievements, appeal essay, interview etc.) I don\u2019t think they will really affect NTU\u2019s IGP as a whole, as you can see from past year statistics.

Both of them have equally good prospects. However, the approach of these programs is actually quite different. For NTU CS, you get to explore more in-depth in terms of programming. SMU, ultimately, is still a business school, so you will be required to take some of the business-related modules as well. Imo, you will have wider choices to choose from if you want to work in tech-related industries after you graduate from NTU. On the other hand, SMU will prepare you more on business-related industries and application of the tools we have. Ultimately, it really depends on where you want to spend your time on. If you are talking about an international recognition, NTU might give you a slight boost.  Both of them are equally difficult, but if you are looking for easier one, you shouldn't choose SMU as their IS have the highest dropout rate despite their \"lower\" criteria. A lot of other factors are involved as well but also it is due to the program requiring you to put a lot of time on their projects. Ofc, I'm also not necessarily indicating NTU is easier as their core curriculum is more on concrete skills of CS. However, you can use your spare time in NTU doing some extracurricular activities and get to have Hall experience. They both have pros/cons.

Totally agree with you that scholarship should not be awarded based on academic performance only, which I did mention in my earlier post. The primary objective of my earlier post aims to encourage individuals who are currently applying/appealing for admission and/or scholarship - through the sharing of my education journey and the challenges experienced as an individual with a disadvantaged background. Subsequently, the post also seeks to highlight the flaws in the basis of selection for the scholarship interview. Today, institutions are still using a uniform assessment method to evaluate people of diverse backgrounds. The assessment for academic potential is pretty straightforward - cGPA, awards, and other academic achievement obtained from other sources (e.g. competitions, courses, etc.). The tricky part lies in the assessment of non-academic components - institutions seek individuals with certain attributes, qualities, and skills (e.g. leadership, teamwork, entrepreneurship, integrity, sports achievement, etc.). And often, institutions only consider school-related activities and/or co-curricular activities as the samples for their assessment.  On a personal note, I believed that those attributes, qualities, and skillscould also beidentified and assessed through employment experience (e.g. customers' testimonials, appraisals by superiors, awards attained, etc.).  In general, institutions should also look beyond the school-related activities and co-curricular activities when assessing the non-academic components of individuals. Hence, granting more flexibility for underprivileged students whose non-academic profile were considered as \"insubstantial\" and thereby allowing  them to have the opportunity to share their stories. Ultimately, an interview is all we need.P.s. I'm glad that your hard work paid off, and congrats on securing that scholarship offered by a private company  (I missed the application deadline for private & government scholarship ) To be shortlisted for interview on the government scholarship with 3.5GPA, you must have some really outstanding non-academic achievements! Do you mind to share with us? And hello senior , assuming you are an SMU student (based on the GPA capped at 4.0). As an individual with similar experience, juggling between full-time work and study is really no joke, not to mention that you are doing it at the University-level and still managed to scored a decent grade. Mind to share what full-time job you work as? Do you study in the day, and work at night/after-school hours? Did you, perhaps, packed all modules into that few days so that you could work for the rest of the days in the week? Sincerely hope that you can share some tips with us/me Networking/cloud computing consultant. And if you can get some really well-known individual in the industry to write recommendation letter would really be helpful.  I think due to my competition award as well as the system I build for one of the major hospital which became part of the national healthcare system.

Never try, never know  I have been a \"regular\" reject for scholarship applications - not even an interview opportunity was given But hey, you may have a better chance than me  Unlike me, an individual with a \"borderline\" profile in CCA and/or other non-academic achievements - the only reason depriving me of a scholarship interview.<Personal Experience - UNI / POLY / ITE> In chronological order:<1> Successfully enrolled into NTU, NUS & SMU for BAcc, but not shortlisted for scholarship interview despite attaining cGPA of 3.91 coupled with a Diploma with Merit in Accountancy.<2> Not shortlisted for scholarship interview despite attaining cGPA of 3.9 and above for all semesters in Year 2 & 3 of the Polytechnic.<3> Not shortlisted for scholarship interview despite attaining perfect cGPA of 4.0 for all semesters in Year 1 of the Polytechnic.<4> Successfully enrolled into Polytechnic for Diploma in Accountancy, but not shortlisted for scholarship interview despite attaining cGPA of 3.88 coupled with a Certificate of Merit in High-nitec in Accounting.<5> Not shortlisted for scholarship interview despite attaining perfect GPA of 4.0 for three out of four semesters in ITE. Coming from a disadvantaged background, I spent most of my time working to facilitate personal living expenses as well as to contribute to the family's finances. And with most of the time spent on work (e.g. after-school hours, weekends, and vacation periods), my investment in non-academic activities (e.g. CCA, competitions, etc.) was limited to 8 hours per week and would often have to give up on activities such as YEP and OIP due to the cost and time involved. Therefore, my non-academic profile was considered to be \"insubstantial\" in comparison with other individuals who had the resources to be a full-time student. Whilst there is nothing wrong with awarding scholarships primarily on academic achievement, the current selection criteria and system may be further skewed against lower-income households, as their children may have less in the areas of co-curricular activities, leadership track record, etc, because of their limited financial resources.

And not those waiter etc which provide no actual value to education other than financially.  And cca is useless. Hello there! Totally agree with you that scholarship should not be awarded based on academic performance only, which I did mention in my earlier post. The primary objective of my earlier post aims to encourage individuals who are currently applying/appealing for admission and/or scholarship - through the sharing of my education journey and the challenges experienced as an individual with a disadvantaged background. Subsequently, the post also seeks to highlight the flaws in the basis of selection for the scholarship interview. Today, institutions are still using a uniform assessment method to evaluate people of diverse backgrounds. The assessment for academic potential is pretty straightforward - cGPA, awards, and other academic achievement obtained from other sources (e.g. competitions, courses, etc.). The tricky part lies in the assessment of non-academic components - institutions seek individuals with certain attributes, qualities, and skills (e.g. leadership, teamwork, entrepreneurship, integrity, sports achievement, etc.). And often, institutions only consider school-related activities and/or co-curricular activities as the samples for their assessment.  On a personal note, I believed that those attributes, qualities, and skillscould also beidentified and assessed through employment experience (e.g. customers' testimonials, appraisals by superiors, awards attained, etc.).  In general, institutions should also look beyond the school-related activities and co-curricular activities when assessing the non-academic components of individuals. Hence, granting more flexibility for underprivileged students whose non-academic profile were considered as \"insubstantial\" and thereby allowing  them to have the opportunity to share their stories. Ultimately, an interview is all we need.P.s. I'm glad that your hard work paid off, and congrats on securing that scholarship offered by a private company  (I missed the application deadline for private & government scholarship ) To be shortlisted for interview on the government scholarship with 3.5GPA, you must have some really outstanding non-academic achievements! Do you mind to share with us? And hello senior , assuming you are an SMU student (based on the GPA capped at 4.0). As an individual with similar experience, juggling between full-time work and study is really no joke, not to mention that you are doing it at the University-level and still managed to scored a decent grade. Mind to share what full-time job you work as? Do you study in the day, and work at night/after-school hours? Did you, perhaps, packed all modules into that few days so that you could work for the rest of the days in the week? Sincerely hope that you can share some tips with us/me "},

I have heard of many cases where 4.0 students and medalists were not shortlisted for LKY-STEP award. I think it is mainly because the scholarships aims to promote lifelong learning and usually are given to people who overcome adversity, rather than based solely on academic/CCA achievements.  This is just from my own observation though "},

NBS has a much larger intake then NUS biz school (1200 vs 800), so you're not really comparing apples to apples.  But one thing I agree on is that it's not really correct to say that NBS is the best. All the 3 local biz schools have equally great reputation, so by what criteria are people really evaluating them on? It's not really possible to say which one is the best objectively because there are so many non-quantifiable factors to consider, but we can say that certain industries and companies probably have their biases."},

{"name": "dumbandbroke", "message": "darksiedluv wrote:  Care to elaborate on which aspect ? NUS biz is quite outdated and traditional for lack of better words whereas SMU is a lot more holistic and develops not just your hard skills but soft skills too. From what I've heard NUS tried to adopt some learning/teaching methods etc from SMU but it didn't integrate well with the rest of NUS' curriculum as it is really just innately traditional.   This, among other reasons is why in recent years SMU grads have been most highly sought after by employers even tho the school brand is not as ~established~ as they speak very well during interviews (not saying that NUS students can't, but I would believe the high class part in SMU contributes to their high competence in that aspect). However I think a pro of NUS biz is that they are quite strong in case competitions which can decorate your resume!  However a lot of people still go to NUS because of the hall life i guess! But if you cant juggle play and study, staying in hall will be very distracting. My SMU friends appreciate the extra time they have from not having hall commitments to take up part-time internships and build up their network of connections."},

I cant talk about PFM because I don't really know much about it, but in regards to your question it really depends on where your interest lies! SMU information systems is arguably the easiest faculty to get into in SMU, however from what my seniors studying there told me, it has the highest dropout rate. However if you manage to push through all 4 years, you would be highly sought by companies as the industry is growing in demand and you would have one of the highest starting pays apart from law and medicine students. I'd say if have absolutely no interest in the field whatsoever, you could consider your other choice instead.  I hope this didn't discourage you in any way! I think SMU IS would be a rather fulfilling course if you have an interest in it. Drop me a PM if you wanna know more about it because my senior gave me a really detailed and in-depth review of the course "},

It was really basic questions then I was given an article and I had to answer two questions regarding the article. It was over in like 20 mins . The interview was quick and surprisingly simple. I guess it depends on the interviewer tho. I read on this thread some of them were asked what history books you have read, what was the latest fiction book they read, etc."},

I think it really depends on who you're friends with though. On one hand, there are people who will get caught up in analysis and stuff, but on the other, there are also people who want to explore Lit and like to read. I'd say don't worry too much, cuz the TAs and profs will be open for consults if you want to refine your writing.  Also, the syllabuses are out: http://www.soh.ntu.edu.sg/Programmes...offerings.aspx For this sem, the Y1s will be taking HL1001, HL1002 and HL1007. For HL1002, don't bother buying the book, cuz it's like $80-90 and you'll not read all of it anyway. I have complied the texts you need from the book into a PDF, and I can share it with you!"},

After that, pick about 3-4 criterias to compare, 3 will do if you do not have time.

{"name": "plsacceptme:(", "message": "cbcplease wrote:  Hello everyone! Like a couple of friends here, I've taken a gap year and only entering university this year. Just wanted to let you guys know, that there's nothing wrong with taking a gap year. When I was applying for uni last year, I was aiming for NUS Life Science and NTU Bio with RP 71. I received a letter of rejection from both schools in mid-May. Of course, I went ahead to appeal and submitted supporting documents (e.g. personal statements, 2 teachers' appeal letter) but they didn't work. NUS rejected my appeal in the first week of June while NTU only got back to me in the first week of July. Of course, I do know one or two who successfully appealed into university even after the initial rejection. But I would like to put it out there, the success rate of appealing into university from an initial rejection is extremely low. It might be better if you used the time spent worrying on something productive instead (e.g. retake A levels/ taking O levels physics to qualify for NTU Engineering courses).  For my case, I called NTU's OAM and they told me that my RP is clearly above the cut off for several engineering courses. They advised me to take O level physics so that I can have more options when I apply in the following year. So I spent July to October studying for O level Physics, which I eventually got an A2. Then I took on several internships and it helped me understand myself more. I've also came to cherish education even more, so this gap year has actually helped me to find my drive.  You've really got to do what you need to do, in order to do what you love. It may be a tough period on you now, but you just have to put in the effort and power through it. Ten years down the road, nobody's going to remember that you took a gap year, because in the end you guys will be at the same destination. All the best! Thanks for sharing! & congrats on your admission this year!  May i know did you send in your teacher's appeal letter to the admissions office? As there's no function to attach any file on the appeal portal."},

Cause pass/fail modules only  Basically the S/U option system NUS currently offers is opened to all faculties (not too sure if Law, Medicine, Dentistry have or not) and how it works is NUS allows first year student to use up to 8 S/U within your first academic year and have 3 more for the rest of your university lifecycle per se. The average NUS student takes 5 mods per semester (10 per academic year) and how the 8 S/U works you basically get you not grade a particular module if your results in that module is unsatisfactory. Meaning say if you get a B+ which is 4.0/5.0 got GPA you can use the S/U and not grade it while still receiving the necessary academic credits that contribute towards your graduation.  With this being said, you can use the S/U system to your advantage by trying to secure the highest possible CAP/CGPA within your first 2 semester so secure a good spot for Student Exchange Programme as well as to better maintain your GPA for subsequent years. Some seniors might tell you \"first year dont s/u too much if not later when you do badly then the drop in ur CGPA becomes more distinct\" while this is true to a certain extent, based on experience using the S/U earlier on more often than not, results in a better CGPA overall. This is due to the fact that apart from your first year, the remaining 3 S/U can only be used on certain modules (most year 2 cores that serve as a pre-requisite for higher level modules cannot s/u) meaning that based on NUS curriculum you can only s/u your general electives (GEMs) or unrestricted electives (UEs - people tend to use this 1 or 2 of them for SEP cos easier to map). For your case since, you come from a poly background, meaning you will be exempted from fulfilling the UEs criteria.  Also, I did mention that personally imo, its better to use your s/u early on, is also due to the fact that you will wanna try to do well for every module and having that s/u may/might impede you from putting in the required effort to do well. In the most simplistic terms, when considering whether to S/U or not think of it this way. If I get 4 B+ and 1 B, consider to s/u the B if you are confident of getting at least the same grade for that 1 module the following semester (in this case, no difference if you s/u now or later so might as well now ...) and if you do score better then good choice.

Will you just be passed from the module as well or do you have to retake it? In year 1 you are able to s/u every single modules even core modules (unless FASS have some specific basket requirement that I am unaware of, you can check with your seniors/OGLs during orientation week or camps; usually they will brief you guys on this including how to bid for modules). In this case, if you S/U it will reflect as S - Satisfactory and you will be granted the modular credits while your grade will NOT be counted to your CAP/GPA. Basically you need to pass the module (at least a C) to be able to receive the modular credits with an S; otherwise D+ or below will only receive a U - Unsatisfactory and while it will not count to your CAP/GPA you will be require to retake the module. Hope this clarifies!"},

However during the interview, they did not ask me which major I would like to choose or anything related to SMT. I am not very keen on SMT but I have more interest in IS so I did make known to them that I wanna learn more about coding which is more IS related. So I was offered IS in the end. 2. Its an individual interview with 2 profs for me. 3. I won\u2019t say it is as challenging as unit 8 lesson 5.

Just wanted to let you guys know, that there's nothing wrong with taking a gap year. When I was applying for uni last year, I was aiming for NUS Life Science and NTU Bio with RP 71. I received a letter of rejection from both schools in mid-May. Of course, I went ahead to appeal and submitted supporting documents (e.g. personal statements, 2 teachers' appeal letter) but they didn't work. NUS rejected my appeal in the first week of June while NTU only got back to me in the first week of July. Of course, I do know one or two who successfully appealed into university even after the initial rejection. But I would like to put it out there, the success rate of appealing into university from an initial rejection is extremely low. It might be better if you used the time spent worrying on something productive instead (e.g. retake A levels/ taking O levels physics to qualify for NTU Engineering courses).  For my case, I called NTU's OAM and they told me that my RP is clearly above the cut off for several engineering courses. They advised me to take O level physics so that I can have more options when I apply in the following year. So I spent July to October studying for O level Physics, which I eventually got an A2. Then I took on several internships and it helped me understand myself more. I've also came to cherish education even more, so this gap year has actually helped me to find my drive.  You've really got to do what you need to do, in order to do what you love. It may be a tough period on you now, but you just have to put in the effort and power through it. Ten years down the road, nobody's going to remember that you took a gap year, because in the end you guys will be at the same destination.

I am interested in entrepreneurship and want to work at a startup or run my own startup in the future.  Reasons why I want to study at NUS: Pros: - More comfortable with NUS's teaching style of lecture and tutorials which is similar to Poly teaching style  - hall life as I want to experience campus living  - can get 5 modules exemptions and graduate within 3.5 years  - chance to participate in NUS Overseas College Programme  Cons: - Heard it is quite competitive and hard to get into honours programme  - perception that NUS Students do not speak as well compared to SMU Students  - non-compulsory internship so need ownself self source  Reasons why I want to study at SMU: pros:  - stronger employment prospects with higher starting salary and employment rate  - compulsory internship - 100% global exposure to Student exchange programmes, etc - can get 5 modules exemptions and graduate within 3-3.5 years  - gain stronger soft skills  Cons: - may not be comfortable with SMU's seminar style of teaching as I don't participate much in tutorials so may affect class participation so you think in NUS u dont need participate in class/ socializing, esp now u gonna stay in hall??"},

However , if you are still waiting for your dream local uni ( yet to offer you , maybe second window ) , you can still accept your dream uni offer once they have offered you.

Nus has a lot of seminar teaching styles now. It is only for content heavy subjects that they use lecture to teach. So you still need to speak up.http://bba.nus.edu/docs/2018-BBA-Brochure.pdf refere to the nus brochure edit: referring to the GES from the one in reddit, NUS honour students has an employment rate of 93.66% and a mean salary of $4388 while smu cum laude students has an employment rate of 92% and a mean salary of $4504. so if you look at this nus has a higher employment rate albeit lower salary.

You should also submit your Singapore-Cambridge GCE O-level results, if available. If you are a student in your final semester of study at the Polytechnic, you can apply with your results obtained from your first 5 semesters of study. You should submit your final semester results to the Office of Admissions, NUS as soon as these are available. Applicants for Nanyang Business School programmes Mathematics skills are essential for entry into Nanyang Business School (NBS). Polytechnic applicants are therefore required to take a NTU Mathematics elective upon admission to NBS if  \uf0d8- Applicants do not have \u2018O\u2019 level Additional Mathematics  \uf0d8- Grade obtained for \u2018O\u2019 level Additional Mathematics is C6 or below Successful polytechnic applicants who do not meet the minimum Mathematics requirement above will be advised on the registration for the Mathematics elective upon matriculation into the University.

That\u2019s why you can\u2019t get into local Uni. You need to get almost full rank points to go to NTU CEE. The IGP table does not apply to PR or foreigner. There is a different set of quota.. Even it seems that the cut off point in the IGP for certain courses is lower, but such benchmarks is not applicable for foreigners/PR. Most courses are equally difficult and competitive for PR/foreigners. Foreigners must score better than locals to enter local Uni, as only 10% is reserved for intl students. 60+ point still want to compete with us born and bred SG citizens for the engineering courses in NTU? Those NTU Engg (CEE, EEE, MSE, ME) courses are reserved for local born and bred citizens who scored 65-70RP. **I feel that those in this thread who are intl students/PR, and scored badly for A Levels, or poor GPA,  you should not have asked why you have been rejected, or what are your chances. This is common-sense, because of your citizenship status. This system is only fair for local SG citizens."},

You stand a chance if you apply through DA, if you had other achievements during your polytechnic days. Otherwise, it will be really tough to enter as I have friends that applied with 3.5-3.6 GPA and did not get in. If you are in national service, the extra 2 chances that you get to apply is massive and you can improve your portfolio yearly. When I graduated from poly, I just had nothing but GPA and got rejected by all 3 universities even with a GPA of 3.7. However, 2 years down the road, I got into 2 out of 3 universities (Other still waiting result) through Discretionary Admission by constantly improving myself through either taking up small courses before my national service, establishing my startup and winning awards, requesting testimonials from my lecturers, as well as reading up on daily news to prepare myself for any interview.

Your gpa is way off the 10th percentile. However your chances can be inflated with extra-curriculars which by now should have granted you a da interview at the very least but everything is left to interpretation both by the universities and on your part. My suggestion to you and the majority of everybody here would be to focus on what you can do now etc, planning alternatives, or really have a seat with yourself and really decide on what you do. The speculation here on this website and other forums are true to a certain extent. We\u2019ll never truly know the application processing methodologies nor will the universities reveal them.  Knowing other people\u2019s grades or interviews accentuate anxiety. Treat yourself better. Like one person mentioned before, dont get caught up in the singaporean dream of going to the big 3 and cloud your judgement or let it impede on your rationality. I\u2019ve seen friends and senior pursuing degrees which they have no interest in, for example chinese, english lit solely because of the name of the university. I challenge everyone to ask yourself, are you willing to forsake perhaps more favourable degrees from so called \u201c lower tier univeristies\u201d and pursue your degree because of institutional reputation. And for those people that like to **** on other people.. be nicer, i appreciate the sense of pragmatism which i feel is extremely lacking here but there are nicer ways of portraying yourself. And for people who are ticked off by these peoples comments, dont respond because responding insinuates an extremely redundant and putrid arguement which diminishes the original intent of this thread."},

The email looks like this: Dear _____,  Congratulations! You would have received an admission offer from the College of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences, NTU Singapore, to the Psychology programme. We are pleased to inform you that the offer comes with a guaranteed second major of your choice. Admission to the programme with a guaranteed second major at our college is particularly competitive, and you are, indeed, among the select students with suitable academic standing who have been admitted to this programme. This programme allows you to read in more depth either courses from two distinct disciplines, or two complementary ones. Either way, you get to broaden your knowledge and insight from two different fields of studies, which will better prepare you for the changing employment landscape. You can choose to take any of the second majors listed below after you complete the first year of your study. Of course, if you prefer to explore widely and take electives from several different disciplines, that, too, is highly encouraged. You are not bound to read a second major; this offer simply guarantees you a place should you wish to do so. List of second majors available from Year 2 onwards (Excluding the major that you have been offered) 1.                        Art History 2.                        Chinese 3.

Thank you! The thing about advising what to appeal is that it is very hard for anyone to advise what to appeal or what not to do.  Appealing is a very personal process and has a lot of different factors to consider which I will try to break down to help you guys in deciding what to appeal for based on your own circumstances. 1) How interested are you in the course - If you are very interested in one course and have absolutely no interest in the other, should you be appealing to the other course even though you may stand a better chance with your RP/GPA?  If you are not on the extreme ends, then maybe you can consider appealing to your second choice or even a completely different course that you think you don't mind doing. 2) How competitive are you - If your RP/GPA is very far from the stated IGP, you should know even appealing would not work. There's a saying to appeal to another course that you did not list as a choice as being rejected means they have processed your application as such - I disagree. At different points in time during the application process, they may or may not be more lenient to those whose RP/GPA are close to the stated IGP. I do think it may be worth trying if you are very interested in the course and did not miss the 10th percentile by too much.  Besides, for some reason, we are seeing people getting accepted with RP/GPAs that are far far away from the 10th percentile. 3) What else do you have to offer - This would refer to your CCAs, awards, external projects etc. If you have a relevant portfolio, you may consider reiterating these achievements/projects in your statement if you are bent on getting into your first choice and are just a few marks away. For DA, there is no appeal to consider yourself for DA again, so whatever portfolio you have is just to show your passion. Don't put too much hope on this - it really boils down to your scores at the end of the day.  All factors are not mutually exclusive to each other. You can appeal for course you know you are very competitive in but if you are not interested, you would know better not to appeal. However, if you are very far from the 10th percentile - how willing are you to let go of your first choice and consider other courses? If you honestly think you have very outstanding achievements but did not get considered for DA, do you want to gamble once more and hope it pays off? Remember - you only get to appeal once. Play it well. "},

All questions to consider, but my main point is to let the other user know that whether you are offered a double major or not should not be a deciding factor. You can always do a minor. In fact, NTU allows up to two minors, which if you really want to consider versatility, may be more useful than a second major. I am holding a private degree but I was chosen over NUS scholars. Employer hire based on how the interview went. I have been working for 8 years; just giving my two cents worth for undergrads.  In all seriousness, work smart. Not work hard. This is crucial when you go into the working industry.

Why in the world would employees pay you more even before you start work just because your GPA is higher?  If you could give me the links of those research that you did, I am keen to take a look.  Personal experience - I took double major but dropped to single. Paying additional 10k (private uni) was not worth it for me as at the end of the day, most companies prefer you to have existing working experience irregardless of relevant degree or not. I have went into different fields (all do not match with my qualifications) and it has never been a problem.  I am in charge of hiring people and double degree do not impress me with zero working experience. Especially coming in demanding high pay and end up being unable to do a decent job.  Another personal experience - My SO was in civil service. Salary is according to what your qualification is i.e. diploma or degree. Not according to GPA. End of year increment and bonus is subjected to work performance. I myself have just started work (private company) but I am getting a lower pay compared to my peers due to long service staff vs newbie despite me having much higher qualifications than them. Another company I went to had all employees start off with the same pay irregardless of experience or qualifications. These are some basic research I did (can\u2019t really find much about it) : https://digitalsenior.sg/getting-a-2nd-major-or-minor/ https://dollarsandsense.sg/pros-and-cons-of-getting-a-double-major-degree-in-singapore/ However, I\u2019d consulted people who are employers, and most of them told me double major will give you an edge, and that it opens up job opportunities! For the higher GPA = higher starting pay, higher GPA gives you a chance to do your honours, and your pay usually depends on whether you had a pass grade vs first class honours. (I\u2019m talking about public sector btw, just like I\u2019d mentioned in the previous post) Even within degree holders, starting pay can be quite different! Can\u2019t say much about private sector though, I\u2019ve always wanted to work in public sector so most of my choices depends on that. For me, I definitely will give up double major! Also, when comparing, (using your example), I think it\u2019s more accurate if you compare NUS scholar (with experience) vs private degree holder(with experience), or Scholar with no experience vs private degree holder with no experience. But I guess interviews play a major part as well"},

Otherwise, currently at the end of Year 1, I do know of some who decide to drop out and do a single major instead. I believe you should be able to take a double major if you wish once admitted so long as you do well enough to prove that you can take the academic rigour of double major.  That said, double majors are really not easy. You have to juggle the demands of two majors when the rest are handling just one, and your entire curriculum is really fixed so you don't have the flexibility of choosing modules you like or get to do UEs, iirc. (From my understanding, the UEs are taken to fulfil requirements for your second major)"},

Personally I think it\u2019s safer to appeal to PFM instead, as your RP is really far off from the 10 percentile of FASS. I think below 70rp, very low chance. I saw someone with 71+ who got rejected from FASS.

Which means that, if you submit an appeal for your first choice now, and you get into your third choice, you cannot change your mind or gameplay by appealing for your second choice instead.  This may or may not work against you, depending on how many choices you have, and how confident are you of your ranking of choices.  As someone who did not get a reply from NUS until late June last year, I do not suggest that you submit an appeal without a response from the unis.  This is to give yourself some leeway and decide your next step of action, especially with consideration of some insights you can gather from the thread.  That being said, if you do not get a response at all until the appeal portal is about to close, then please submit an appeal before it closes.  Universities can give out offers right up till the academic year starts.  The wait is still long guys. Really no point panicking. "},

I was abused by a room tenant. Failed my psle. Passed on my second attempt. Dropped out from secondary school as I was involved in gang activities. Fast forward... After my NS, did my N level as a private candidate - at the age of 21. Did very badly. Rejected by ITE. Appealed. Got it with multiple interviews. Partly due to my pro-criminal background too - no shame to share as I've changed. Went to NYP. Currently, got 3 offers from the big3 - at the age of 27. In conclusion, don't label yourself with negative words as it would shape your thoughts, feelings and behavior. When I was younger, I thought I was those cannot study type one - had an extremely low self-efficacy. I felt hopeless, useless and had series of suicidal ideation. If you really something, don't ever give up. Alternatively, there are many other options out there. You just need to alter the way you look at those options, to more positive ones in the sense.

Appealed. Got it with multiple interviews. Partly due to my pro-criminal background too - no shame to share as I've changed. Went to NYP. Currently, got 3 offers from the big3 - at the age of 27. In conclusion, don't label yourself with negative words as it would shape your thoughts, feelings and behavior. When I was younger, I thought I was those cannot study type one - had an extremely low self-efficacy. I felt hopeless, useless and had series of suicidal ideation. If you really something, don't ever give up. Alternatively, there are many other options out there. You just need to alter the way you look at those options, to more positive ones in the sense. Ultimately, work experiences and attitude are more crucial than academic grades. With Love, Gary  Thank you so much Gary!! I really appreciate your words of encouragement, and sincerely wish you all the best in your future endeavours. You are a kind soul and I hope life gives you everything you deserve. Cheers "},

However i got into an accident shortly after which left me immobilized and extremely distracted and i couldn't study properly. Alas, i did worse for my second As, 60 rank points. This year, I applied to NUS PFM, bc i have friends who got the same rank points as me and even slightly lower, whom i know have less achievements than me get into PFM. I really banked my hopes on this, and i just received the news that i got rejected. I'm feeling really dejected right now, i'm not sure if i was rejected because i applied so late (2nd day before application deadline) or they took my 2nd a level attempt results even tho i submitted both year's results and indicated i wanted to use my 66.75 rank points. Maybe, i'm just simply not good enough for uni. Can someone shed light to whether i have any chance of appealing in? And how would you suggest i go about doing it, like what should i write in my essay?

So worst come to worst if you s/u thinking that you did very badly but miraculously you get an A or sth, too bad you have already s/u the mod. (But my friends in ntu did say this kind of situation is rare and you will definitely know whether you did well for the mod or not so no worries) This part is debatable but many say smu is easier to get higher GPA because of the 4.3/4.0. For ntu and nus, A and A+ is still 5/5. So now mater how many A+ you have, you get only 5.0 for your cap. Some say still ntu and nus gets a s/u option so the 4.3 thingy in smu is like s/u option. But for ntu and nus, you are only given s/u options in y1 and y2 only. But note that s/u isnt always good as if you do s/u your mod, it means there are less number of mods to average out the cap so it means if you s/u a lot of mods, after finishing your y2, if you do badly in y3, your gpa will drop a lot compared to a person who never s/u b4 and so it is very difficult to pull up your gpa. However, for smu if you get a+, you get an bonus for your cap so easier to pull up your cap although no s/u cause this applies throughout your uni life be it you get a+ in y1 or y4. But then again getting an A+ isnt as easy as it may sound like. Basically what I want to say is both system has its pros and cons and doesn't mean smu is easier to score. Hope the info I searched in accurate"},

If you do a bit more research, I believe SMU has many different programs (summer/intern/exchange/work of varying durations) for you to go overseas and you can definitely pick one that suits your needs best. I believe if cost is an issue, SMU definitely has bursaries/scholarships/needs-based aid to help you go overseas and you should take this opportunity and go out to explore the world. With the implementation of such a rule, I am sure SMU will ensure no student will have to scrimp and save in order to fulfil this graduation requirement. Check out what they have to offer in terms of aid before you decide.  As an undergraduate now, I personally believe overseas exposure is very important as there is so much to see and do and learn that even the best universities in SG cannot provide you. For example, I am going to Seoul for summer school and the university I am going has many North and South Korean politics-related modules that you cannot get in SG. It is also the experience of being overseas for an extended period of time, away from the comforts of SG and learning to live on your own that I think would be special for most, given that we are most likely stuck on this island for the rest of our lives.

Soci seems to be trying to caliberate themselves. Their 10th percentile dropped by 0.07 last year and their intake was smaller than usual. I am not sure what they are doing, cos' there were people who applied for Soci as first choice and is well over the 10th percentile (3.7x) but got their second choice, PPGA instead.  Perhaps place your hopes on LMS? But how NTU works is that if your higher options don't let go of you, your lower options won't see light of your application.

Thanks so much for the information. This makes sense bc ive seen on this forum that people with higher gpa have got into PPGA or psych despite soci being their first choice! And yes their igp and cohort size has dropped, although I\u2019m not sure why haha. Isit bc soci is less desirable now hence the drop and smaller cohort size? From this site, I\u2019ve also seen ppl with higher and lower gpa not hearing from soci :/  Hmm, I was hoping for LMS too!! But it\u2019s already approaching mid May and I still didn\u2019t recieve any interview emails or calls. Which is why I\u2019m unsure if I\u2019m already rejected (my third to fifth choice were beyond my gpa) or like what you said, soci hasn\u2019t let go of me and hence I\u2019m just dangling there.  Thanks so much for the information though, regardless of a rejection or acceptance letter I\u2019ll still at least have a clearer picture of this process. Much better than being unsure if my application has gone through etc when I recieved no interview or calls. (:"},

Just whether at this point in time your case belongs to the silence is golden or silence is bad news side of things.  In last year's thread, some with GPAs/RPs near the 10th percentile were still being accepted in the 2nd window, aka they did not from the schools at all until June.  Of course, that can mean when you eventually hear back from them, it is rejection.  Like I have said before, you can keep coming into this thread and check and panic when someone gets accepted into the course you want and you haven't, but that is no way going to help you get your results faster. If you are safely 10th percentile and above and is a Singaporean citizen, you would most likely be accepted. Well, I applied to soci, and lms is my 2nd choice, to which it requires an interview.

It's not a MUST to retake all your H2s... because as 4H2s, you can CHOOSE the subject you want to treat as a H1, which is obviously the worst grade H2, but it can be any random subject if you get what I mean. While for people with 3H2s+1H1, they have a fixed H1 subject. Yes you can bring over your B in chem, acc to the grades you have listed. Or actually more like your first year results would be used since your second year results dipped a bit. But either way, you don't have to be worried cos by right MOE will help you calculate your highest RP, I've called in to check."},

For RCs, you need take GE modules and they'll guarantee you 2 years of stay (at least for some colleges...). It's more  for people who like peaceful studying. Idk if need go interview but the application requires you to write two essays about yourself, achievements etc. For halls, I'm not sure if there's any interview, but you're only guaranteed 1 year if accepted. Good thing is you don't have required modules to take there. It's all just CCAs of fun, sports, dancing and stuff. But if you don't ignore the social life and don't get involved, be prepared to get kicked out in 2nd year"},

From what I know, some have not heard from Tembusu, but if I'm not wrong, all the interview slots for CAPT have been taken up (and I went for the CAPT interview just this Monday!). If your application in the RC portal is still processing, that would be strange... some have been rejected by RCs already (not offered interview at all), while some people's applications have been released to the common pool for other RCs' consideration. Furthermore, the second window of RC applications has opened, and I don't think your application will be brought over to the second application window, but you should call in to ask just in case. If you don't receive any email asking for interview with any of the RCs by end May, I think it's safe to assume that you have been rejected by RC. Hope this helps and hope you get an interview offer soon!! There's still time left till 24 May (-: Hi!

Hi, I did some studies on ntu accountancy since I was offered the dd course If your son wants to enter a big four firm, there are approximately more ntu accountancy graduates than smu accepted by them each year. Not sure if single degree accountancy is a 3years course. Heard from someone that it is. This means that 3 years accountancy students from nbs have to compete against their older peers who studied 1 more year in university. For smu, I didn\u2019t apply accountancy so not much research. If your son wants to do a double major with biz or econs or IS, it is the place to go. For my faulty that I got accepted into, around 80% students graduate with a double major. I applied something else at nus but I would advise your son to accept ntu or smu first. If nus offers you accountancy in the second application window, you can still change your course and accept nus\u2019s offer. This is as by 24 May, the ntu and smu offers will be invalidated."},

So they may already have a list of all whom they want to offer a place in SMU to. This tail end is just obligatory interviews they give to show that they give everyone a chance. As long as you didn't receive a rejection, there is always hope. Cos definitely there will be people who give up their SMU place for other unis.

{"name": "giantgreypigeon", "message": "nekomon wrote:  Hi there! You would need to submit a 500 word / 2000 character essay explaining your grounds of appealing. You can only choose ONE course to appeal to. There is no need to submit any other additional documents, although you may write in directly to the faculty you're appealing to (more on that later). I have to be frank with you that appealing into a course where your RP does not meet the cut-off for the IGP will be almost impossible. They have a reason why they rejected you in the first place... As far as I know, successful appeals are more applicable to those who want to appeal to another course because they've changed their mind on their offer. And it all depends on the vacancies left for the course as well. The smaller the course, the lower your chances of getting a successful appeal as they have their vacancies filled up already. I got 70rp last year and my application to NUS FASS got rejected (the cut-off was 78.75). I immediately submitted an online appeal, and even wrote personal letters on why I wanted FASS and how I would like an interview to further present myself to the deans of FASS, and submitted them by mail. However, my appeal was unsuccessful in the end, despite all my efforts of appealing. I suggest you sign up for retaking A levels now, if not you would have to think of other back-up plans... All the best! Just to add on to this for anyone\u2019s that\u2019s interested ^ I applied to NUS last year with FASS being my first choice, and somehow ended up with my sixth choice of Real Estate (my rp is 75). I accepted it anyway, then submitted appeal to transfer to FASS. I\u2019m not very certain if they look at rp when it\u2019s course transfer, because as far as I\u2019m concerned I did not submit any documents and only provided a fifty-worded sentence why I think I\u2019m of better fit in FASS than RE. (I got accepted) Also do sign up for Arts Camp! "},

Edit: got 70.875+1.25rp Hi there! You would need to submit a 500 word / 2000 character essay explaining your grounds of appealing. You can only choose ONE course to appeal to. There is no need to submit any other additional documents, although you may write in directly to the faculty you're appealing to (more on that later). I have to be frank with you that appealing into a course where your RP does not meet the cut-off for the IGP will be almost impossible. They have a reason why they rejected you in the first place... As far as I know, successful appeals are more applicable to those who want to appeal to another course because they've changed their mind on their offer. And it all depends on the vacancies left for the course as well. The smaller the course, the lower your chances of getting a successful appeal as they have their vacancies filled up already. I got 70rp last year and my application to NUS FASS got rejected (the cut-off was 78.75). I immediately submitted an online appeal, and even wrote personal letters on why I wanted FASS and how I would like an interview to further present myself to the deans of FASS, and submitted them by mail. However, my appeal was unsuccessful in the end, despite all my efforts of appealing. I suggest you sign up for retaking A levels now, if not you would have to think of other back-up plans... All the best!"},

Thank you all for the help when I received the results because I was really worried about not getting my first choice for NUS back then haha. To those who haven't received their offers, good luck!"},

If we miss the FASS camp, are there any other camps in fass? Thanks For faculty wide, there's 2 camps, Arts camp and Arts O week. Then there's major camps which typically are smaller like Psychology camp, sociology camp, economics camp and so on. The thing is that to ensure a gender balance, female signups typically close EARLY because FASS after all. For males, usually, they are begging you to join to ensure there's some male presence. For arts open day on 12th May, many camps are setting up a booth and opening registration. For the camps I'm involved in, we are only having registrations but I think arts camp are running signups and collecting payment. Usually first come first serve if you're a female. Males generally are more sought after for FASS camps to be honest "},

I can't say for arts camp but for other camps that don't have you going to clubs, the money is really used for camp purposes.  The camp has toned down since 2016 when the whole hooha exploded."},

Majority of FASS camps especially the major camps can't afford to go clubbing anyway. It's mainly the faculty camps and NUSSU camps like union camp that has these activities.

A lot of applicants at 18/19 years old are still quite uncertain on what they want to do in the future, and end up making a less than ideal decision in their university choice. Quite common to hear of people ended up working in a totally different industry from what they studied. In that sense, sort of wasted what they studied, and ended up having 0 relevance to their job.  For Accountancy, it's not too late to hop on board if you want to join after graduation!  While most of us would still consider accountancy to be a professional degree, it is not the only path to joining the profession.

Or you take it up merely for the sake of job security.  If not you will be wasting time studying that as chances are you will not be working as one if you don't like it. I feel that Business consists of a diverse array of sub-disciplines that do not really interrelate. And, for any given business student, some of these sub-disciplines are not exactly beneficial to his chosen area of specializiation (i.e. supply chain management probably is not very helpful to a finance student). So Business is less integrated as a subject, wherein the courses build on each other, compared to Accoutancy. If one were to take a business degree and second major in accounting, I believe it would not be as advantageous to him as taking an accountancy degree and second major-ing in a Business major. This is by virtue of the fact that accountancy courses are more closely interrelated and are better studied as a cohesive whole.  This being said, it is also possible that a Business student would choose an area of focus that has really good synergy with a second Business major (i.e. marketing and entrepreneurship). So I can see the rationale for sticking with Business as well. Bottom line: In my humble opinion, if one is interested in both accoutanting and a relevant business major, picking Accoutancy as the primary degree and the Business major as a second major is a better choice than vice versa."},

I received mine 6 days later, while I have heard of some who received theirs just a day later for the exact same interview date and time slot.  Actually, my conjecture is that the offers are not necessarily released respective to the chronological order of the interview dates.  SMU probably chooses certain dates to release mass offers, which may be accumulated from several prior interview dates; i.e. a block of offers are sent out on  12/04, some for the 28/03 interview, some for the 6/04 interview, some for the 10/04 interview.  So for any given interview date, some offers may be released a day or two after, others a week later (along with offers for a later interview), and etc.  Don\u2019t be too stressed.

Actually, my conjecture is that the offers are not necessarily released respective to the chronological order of the interview dates.  SMU probably chooses certain dates to release mass offers, which may be accumulated from several prior interview dates; i.e. a block of offers are sent out on  12/04, some for the 28/03 interview, some for the 6/04 interview, some for the 10/04 interview.  So for any given interview date, some offers may be released a day or two after, others a week later (along with offers for a later interview), and etc.  Don\u2019t be too stressed.

{"name": "Pokraisra", "message": "rabbit1 wrote:  Pls share more :/ Well here\u2019s what I had experienced from NUS EE not sure if had mentioned before so here goes.  Was a Singapore polytechnic DEEE graduate from 2014 graduation and took decision to go to NUS EE entered in 2016/2017 S1 where the modules introduced were quite daunting tbh. The environment was not great with lots of competition for project modules and even for tests and exams where test scores when revealed shows the average or median mark and see where you stand within the cohort taking the module. So as many know it\u2019s under this bell curve system so depending on cohort performance you can get higher or lower grades. This part irks me as when crunch periods you wouldn\u2019t wanna help too much and result others to potentially overtake you for those grades.  Terms of lifestyle in EE it\u2019s a myth there\u2019s any sort of life beyond mugging as most modules require constant revision to grasp concepts and to apply them for the various types of assessments. Ppl who say enter Uni got cca and other commitments typically either those priority not so much on grades but for well rounded perspective. Feel there\u2019s growing trend of exploitation of exchange programmes or summer school programmes to map modules overseas and causing schemes to map the harder modules overseas to count as pass/fail instead of being graded. This can create quite an unfair perspective that only with money make the life easier just like that. But modules taken they range many applications of maths and physics with some modules emphasis of programming causing most problems. Expect a tight schedule to juggle the assignments and projects depending on modules as before you know it left exams to grind for and it\u2019s been constantly there for now the 4th semester out of 6 semesters I have experienced so far. More details on modules I did can look at NUS EE recommended schedule for 2016/2017 direct entry poly students 3 years programme. Only difference for me I took diploma plus programme for Maths so I was exempted from MA1301, a bridging maths module and did smth else instead which was ES1103 for those scoring band 2 for QET. Feel free ask more about those within NUS EE, for NTU EE can check someone else. Ps: For myself poly entrant, wasn\u2019t entitled to compulsory 6 months internship within the Uni education so I had to secure a 3 months version myself to get this experience as wasn\u2019t part of curriculum."},

For SMU SIS Interaction day, if your email state that no preparation is needed then it would probably be the same experience as mine.  First we enter into a holding area where they let us connect to the visitor wifi. Then we were brought to a seminar room and the lecturer introduce themselves and more about the school via an online quiz (KAHOOT). Its not a competitive quiz but more of a sharing session about the future or IT and the program/tracks offer by SMU SIS.  Afterwards, a year 2 SMU student come in and share her experience in SMU and theres a mini Q&A session with her.  Lastly, we were given a comic strip with regards to future innovation. 5 min to read the quiz, then in groups of 4, we were supposed to list the innovations, issues and solution. The lecturer will walk around while we discuss in groups to ensure we're on the right track. After about 15 min, we were to present it to them. However, not every group were given equal opportunity to present. The floor is open for any group to present. Only 3-5 person manage to share their thoughts before they wrap up. Not exactly sure how they're going to access us.  Honestly, theres not much to prepare and just go with the flow. Hope i get in though"},

Well relating to this even if there might be drop in cut off points, honestly culture of competition is bit harsh in Uni so still gonna be stressful for sure.  Plus side note that the ranking etc is partially cause of the professors writing thesis and lots on student efforts, quality wise still subjective at times way modules are taught can be quite tough indeed."},

I think the \"drop\" is because the cut-off stated on the University websites is just the 10th & 90th percentiles, meaning that there is still 10% of the students  who did not meet that result but got in. However, the results seen here include the 10% of students, so there will definitely be a certain difference in results."},

No way could rest laurels each semester keeps getting tougher exponentially.:O Competition quite gruelling as I had to dig deep even with programming modules that I struggled, still claw back to decent B+ for those and coming August already commencing FYP so for poly going to Uni in 3 years is pretty crazy and had to forgo activities or ccas etc. Before enter Uni always thought can handle more but all came crashing down weeks after entering.\ud83d\ude02"},

Did you take a uni  course related to your diploma or something else completely different? Haha well yeah was a Singapore Polytechnic graduate from DEEE in 2014 and honestly huge difference in way things are poly and Uni. One huge stress factor definitely is bell curve system which just makes things harder. Like used to don\u2019t mind helping cause Polytechnic grading as long as hit mark required can get grade you want already. But University all hinges on how peers fared. Another is the learning curve. Literally there\u2019s no test week and we were required to juggle tests prep on TOP of assignments and projects during recess week so there\u2019s hardly room for breathers. Note now it\u2019s week 13 in Uni and having tests week with some deadlines I cleared ahead of time so gotta strategize which to try and complete earlier.  Third is surely free time which is Super lacking in Uni. This semester had to do one module held during evenings 6-9pm with another specialisation I chose also held night times. The schedule can become quite gruelling. Oh yeah from SP DEEE to NUS EE so yeah relevant in a crash course 3 year programme its been hell tbh."},

Personally from NUS Electrical Engineering and did observe some good and weak points as well as hearing feedback from NTU own problems for EEE if ppl are considering. NUS pros:  As poly direct entry student, the curriculum also can be fit into 3 years.  Observe curriculum from my batch to new batch having revamps to curriculum so those entering this year can benefit from last year\u2019s batch or so called guinea pig batch new stuff. SU system well for myself I got not many lvl 1000 modules so the SU can turn not so satisfactory grades to not count in CAP up to 5 throughout and more after results out to decide on SU Classes since cohort smaller so there\u2019s quite some interaction with jc peers. Cons:  Since less cohort, can get quite competitive handling modules  There is no compulsory 6 months internship for direct entry poly students while only providing for JC peers much more options for internship opportunities. Had to source for limited 3 months internship programme instead I managed to secure from May. Despite taking 5/6 modules per semester, workload for semester can get quite crazy with some parts requiring own revision or self reading to handle new content. Had to pretty much revise near Everyday to keep up with stuff taught. NTU pros:  Large cohort, not so crazy competition when you put in effort. Compulsory 6 months internship for both jc and poly students giving good experience NTU cons: Number of modules to do per semester can be more to accommodate the 6 months internship, potential workload more intensive. Quality of teaching might be affected since lecture theatres only can fit some numbers and impossible to fit all within a cohort within one lecture theatre.  SU system heard was decide modules to SU before results so you might make wrong choice SU when grade can be ok due to cohort bell curve.

Regardless you should focus on yourself to give your best once you enter each semester and competition should be secondary. Lots of difference between poly and Uni education hence I struggled at times. Those entering Uni from poly are the cream of the crop from respective polytechnics so really need to perform. Well said, but it should be applied to all Universities as well. Regardless of which University you are going to, do your best in that course you are going for.Nightwalker123 wrote:  Anyone has any tips for NTU Biz interview? I am from JC and its probably cause of my gp. Although I went for my Accountancy interview, I feel that it is the same for Biz. It involves some questions to get to know you well (Think of it as an introduction to yourself like your hobby etc.), which then he/she will ask why you choose NBS (NTU business school) and why NTU Biz.  Tip: Just be calm, don't panic, and of course, show your enthusiasm for joining NTU Biz"},

Apologies for the delay in response.Sorry I don't hit the post count as well so I guess I'll just say it here.  The overall vibe of the interview was very chill and casual. The interviewers tone was friendly and not pressuring so don't be too nervous! The questions they asked were along the lines of Singapore's economy and policies e.g. why there's no unemployment insurance and minimum wage in SG, so I think it'll be a safe bet to read up more on SG's policies first before reading about other countries.  It's a group interview and everyone will definitely have a chance to speak up (professor will facilitate discussion and prompt answers from interviewees so do take the time you need to think about the question when others are giving their opinions. Last tip which is pretty cliche, but please don't be nervous about the interview at all! Treat it as a platform to share your thoughts and you'll do just fine "},

{"name": "Pokraisra", "message": "Hmm well felt should give own take when deciding between NTU and NUS. Personally from NUS Electrical Engineering and did observe some good and weak points as well as hearing feedback from NTU own problems for EEE if ppl are considering. NUS pros:  As poly direct entry student, the curriculum also can be fit into 3 years.  Observe curriculum from my batch to new batch having revamps to curriculum so those entering this year can benefit from last year\u2019s batch or so called guinea pig batch new stuff. SU system well for myself I got not many lvl 1000 modules so the SU can turn not so satisfactory grades to not count in CAP up to 5 throughout and more after results out to decide on SU Classes since cohort smaller so there\u2019s quite some interaction with jc peers. Cons:  Since less cohort, can get quite competitive handling modules  There is no compulsory 6 months internship for direct entry poly students while only providing for JC peers much more options for internship opportunities. Had to source for limited 3 months internship programme instead I managed to secure from May. Despite taking 5/6 modules per semester, workload for semester can get quite crazy with some parts requiring own revision or self reading to handle new content. Had to pretty much revise near Everyday to keep up with stuff taught. NTU pros:  Large cohort, not so crazy competition when you put in effort. Compulsory 6 months internship for both jc and poly students giving good experience NTU cons: Number of modules to do per semester can be more to accommodate the 6 months internship, potential workload more intensive. Quality of teaching might be affected since lecture theatres only can fit some numbers and impossible to fit all within a cohort within one lecture theatre.  SU system heard was decide modules to SU before results so you might make wrong choice SU when grade can be ok due to cohort bell curve. Transport end of loop for NTU school of EE so expect Longer travelling hours for peak hours. Alright cause tried new forum post for queries but decided place comparisons here for those thinking between them. More descriptions I can provide later.\ud83e\udd14"},

It might also be either because of your Maths, or you are coming from a different field. For me, my English is C6 and I am also from Engineering in Poly (Could not get into Accountancy due to my L1R4 at the time.) The interview is for the professor(s) to get to know you well (Your personal interest etc., basically your hobby.), and also for asking you the reason why you choose NTU and why do you choose this course (If you are coming from different field.). Last one is a Q&A, meaning they will ask you whether if you have any questions before the interview ends. What I can tell you is: Do not panic. Know the job prospects well. For example, if I study Accountancy or Business (In a certain track), what can I become when I graduate?  However, that is just the interview I went through. Your interview may differ depending on what you say in the interview. Fortunately, the 2nd paragraph I posted is the standard questions that they will ask you."},

All the best for your interview next week!  My gpa is 3.88 but I did badly in O level. Basically you need to go the test before the interview. Dont be nervous for the test cause it was conducted with some group of senior students in SMU IS (I even had some conversations with them) just focus on it. There were 2 choices, coding test (Karel IDE) or web heuristic. Most of the people that went for the interview that day chose coding test. You were given a sheet of paper with printed Karel IDE coding outcome (pattern) that you need to write a code to generate the same pattern. You were given 15 mins for the test. I finished it like 5 mins, so dont worry. Try and learn from the link that they gave you in the email for your preparation. Once you're done, they will send your code to the interviewer (your test room and interviewing room are 2 different places) and you wait for your time to be interviewed.  During the interview, the interviewer will look at your code and analyse it, and ask whether you can improve your code (in my case) by using what function. Then after that, they start to ask your background, why do you choose this course and they even ask whether are we applying to another uni and how is the process. Try to ask any question that you may have since once they have finished their part, they will start asking whether you have any questions or not, if not your interview may end there and perhaps they would think that you are not an active person (as you didnt ask). In my case, I read their program details, and I asked them regarding the fast track master program 4 or 4.5 years with Carnegie Mellon University USA.

I am also deciding between nus and smu. Currently reading some year 1 stuff to see which one I like more I got SMU econs,  NUS FASS DMP and NBS offer tooWow your research is so detailed! Haha  Some things I would like to clarify for the benefit of everyone, which is based on my own knowledge and experience talking to friends across all 3 universities.  First and foremost, please take the employment surveys as a pinch of salt. Your salary won't be guaranteed to be higher just because you are enrolled in a particular university that is reported to have higher gross starting pay. Trust me,  when I was deciding on uni like you guys many years ago, I was affected by the graduate employment survey as well but then after years in uni and finally working,  I realised the survey might be misleading... Just so you know, most of these times when the graduates answer these surveys, the schools don't even check whether the pay you entered is true or not...How much you will get for your starting pay depends on your EXPERIENCE, your GRADES, your NEGOTIATION SKILLS, the ECONOMIC OUTLOOK at that POINT IN TIME,  the INDUSTRY and JOB SCOPE. Which uni honestly doesn't matter, cos all 3 local unis are considered on par to one another in the employers' eyes.  and it's just gross pay. There are other components in a salary package like bonuses and benefits which are not captured in the employment surveys. Some people may have a lower gross pay but may have higher bonuses and benefits (eg more days of leave) than someone with higher gross pay who may have less attractive bonuses and benefits. And many times, these surveys are not even representative of the whole student population as not all 100% of the graduating cohort would have completed the survey. Maybe it's just that small handful of students who did the survey and skewed the data?  regarding the point about students in nus being only able to source for internships from career office... That is not true at all. You can always self source (meaning you apply via websites like linkedin for eg by yourself) Oh and student exchange definitely must apply via student office regardless of whether is it nus ntu or smu... Cos all uni already have a list of overseas exchange partner universities that students can apply to then the student office will facilitate the process lor. The process is more or less the same across all 3 uni de.  And one more thing about nus I thought is worth mentioning, they have this NUS Overseas College (NOC) programme where you get to spend 1 year overseas studying and interning... You get to accumulate overseas work exp and clear modules like exchange as well. And the internships are paid. And there are many countries u can go to via this programme - Europe, Asia, USA. Do look it up. I kinda regretted not going \ud83d\ude2d cos it's such a valuable opportunity esp if u are passionate about entrepreneurship.Even if u are not its fine it's still great overseas exposure and it value adds to your resume! Oh and every school is competitive, not just SMU because regardless of which course or uni you go to, the bell curve is everywhere.  Choose your school based on the curriculum, the non academic opportunities available and the culture. Talk to seniors Or students who are studying in the universities and courses you have in mind to find out more. Talk to the recent students who have just graduated to find out more about the actual employment prospects and salary trends across the various unis and courses.  Hope this helps more people to come to a decision on which school to choose."},

When you reach there for your interview timeslot, you register with your NRIC, and you will be given this small card that indicates your group (e.g. B6, meaning you are in group B). Together with other interviewees, you will be brought to this seminar room where it's a waiting room. I waited for about 20mins before we were all brought to another room with tables and chairs for the reading of the article. You'll sit together with your group at a table and you'll be given sufficient time to read the article. Once everyone finishes reading, you can discuss with your group members about the article briefly.  Once the profs are ready, your group will then be called up to a separate seminar room where the actual interview will be begin. There are 2 profs, one facilitator (who is going to ask the questions) and one moderator (who will observe the discussion and take down notes on each student). For my experience, the interview was very chill and enjoyable. Both profs were really nice, as well as my groupmates. We gave each other equal chances to speak, and we spoke about 4-5 times each, which was really good. The article will mostly be about current affairs, so there is no need to specially prepare beforehand. Just be mentally prepared and relax so that you don't end up stammering/blanking out during the interview. All the best! (-:"},

The prof who interviewed me did not focus on asking too many specific questions but he just let the conversation flow and tried to get a feel of my thought process.  Some advice I can give you is to  1. Know what career you wish to pursue in the future and how LMS can help you. Also read up on Lingusitics and what it entails. 2. Read up on their modules and internships they have, tell the interviewer how it is related to your career goals and how these can develop you in your future job etc 4.

{"name": "Lazysotong", "message": "Jessic wrote:  Hi, can anyone share with me whether FASS or smu soss is better? Rlly need advice on this! Thks! Hi, it depends on whether u prefer seminar style lessons or standard lecture-tutorial style of teaching.  I heard from a senior in fass that 1 module in fass is about 1 lecture & 1 tutorial per week btw. The benefits of smu: 1. You get to interact and actively engage yourself during lessons. 2. More internship and exchange opportunities than nus. 3. Many students take double majors and more % taking double degree. 4. More specialisation tracks. 5. Higher employment and salary on average according to the employment survey. The downsides of smu: 1. Competition in smu is fierce. 2. Less campus life (in terms of hall etc) 3. The % of honours students there is lower than fass as it is harder to achieve honours in smu. 4. Less opportunities to make friends (Depends on your personality) The advantages of fass: 1. Lecture-tutorial style of learning, good for shy students who prefer mugging in a corner 2. Higher % of honours 3. Greater cohort size >> bell curve affects students less 3. You can take double majors too by DA or in the 2nd/3rd year 4. More campus life 5. Can stay in RC/hall etc. 6. For eg. econs is more academic and math inclined 7. World QS ranking The disadvantages of NUS: 1. Must find internships & exchange opportunities via the student (?) office. 2. Heavier and more modules esp for double major students (be prepared). I was offered double majors via DA, I counted 4 more modules for NUS than smu for the same double major combination. 3. More in depth and harder modules than smu (from my senior). 4. Hall/RC life may affect your academics. 5. Less specialisation tracks than smu.  Disclaimer ** What I think is subjective, I don\u2019t mean to offend any NUS/SMU students reading this \ud83d\ude05 This is the summary of my \u2018research\u2019 haha xD.

I think what you should factor in your decision is which school would you prefer in terms of the curriculum and culture. In terms of employment opportunities and prospects I would say the 3 local biz schools are the same...  Perks of NUS is that there is this Gradeless first year thing where you can choose to SU your CORE modules aka your home faculty modules. I think this Gradeless first year thing is really helpful because usually we tend to screw up our GPA in year 1 cos we are still trying to adjust to the uni style of school... But personally coming from NUS biz I feel some of our modules may be  more academically driven compared to SMU and NTU imo.But then again what u learn in school usually u hardly apply it in the working world anw  NTU Biz offers direct honours 3 years programme whereas NUS and SMU ones are both 4 years - meaning to say if you don't take leave of absence you only have 2 opportunities to do summer internships vs smu and nus students who have 3 summer opportunities. I guess this is something you can factor in especially the more prestigious internships eg those in banking and fmcg tend to target only penultimate year students... So as a nbs student you can apply for them when u are in y2 but u will be competing with the nus and smu y3 students...(who may have already accumulated more internship experience in their resume with that additional year) but on the other hand as Ntu offers direct honours you get to finish your degree the quickest than your nus and smu peers so you can start work earlier and accumulate full time working exp earlier?  Location is another thing to consider. Smu location is definitely the best. but if you want a hostel life then nus and ntu can offer that.  If finances are a problem, smu school fees are the most expensive based on what I know.  It is hard to say which biz school is the best because they each have their own strengths and tbh it doesn't make a difference when it comes to employment. (BTW don't just solely trust employment or graduate surveys... Not many grads fill them up anw so the figures may be skewed as it may not be representative of the whole student population)  Well written, covers a number of the pertinent considerations!"},

Then if i were to choose NUS later on, i can call NTU to retract the offer and go ahead with accepting NUS's offer. I don't know how true this is but it is what the Admissions Office of NUS personnel said to me. Hope this helps you."},

{"name": "ehnamonimoo", "message": "darksiedluv wrote:  What about versus NUS business ? Hi personally I think all 3 uni are rather similar in terms of prospects for banking careers.  I think what you should factor in your decision is which school would you prefer in terms of the curriculum and culture. In terms of employment opportunities and prospects I would say the 3 local biz schools are the same...  Perks of NUS is that there is this Gradeless first year thing where you can choose to SU your CORE modules aka your home faculty modules. I think this Gradeless first year thing is really helpful because usually we tend to screw up our GPA in year 1 cos we are still trying to adjust to the uni style of school... But personally coming from NUS biz I feel some of our modules may be  more academically driven compared to SMU and NTU imo.But then again what u learn in school usually u hardly apply it in the working world anw  NTU Biz offers direct honours 3 years programme whereas NUS and SMU ones are both 4 years - meaning to say if you don't take leave of absence you only have 2 opportunities to do summer internships vs smu and nus students who have 3 summer opportunities. I guess this is something you can factor in especially the more prestigious internships eg those in banking and fmcg tend to target only penultimate year students... So as a nbs student you can apply for them when u are in y2 but u will be competing with the nus and smu y3 students...(who may have already accumulated more internship experience in their resume with that additional year) but on the other hand as Ntu offers direct honours you get to finish your degree the quickest than your nus and smu peers so you can start work earlier and accumulate full time working exp earlier?  Location is another thing to consider. Smu location is definitely the best. but if you want a hostel life then nus and ntu can offer that.  If finances are a problem, smu school fees are the most expensive based on what I know.  It is hard to say which biz school is the best because they each have their own strengths and tbh it doesn't make a difference when it comes to employment. (BTW don't just solely trust employment or graduate surveys... Not many grads fill them up anw so the figures may be skewed as it may not be representative of the whole student population)"},

{"name": "Cedr1c", "message": "givemesushi wrote:  hi i also got in ntu ppga and nus fass, as well as smu social sci. also got offered guaranteed second major. very unsure which one to go for! im quite certain i will major in pol sci even if i go nus fass and i have consulted ppl, they are all of the view fass is more reputable and nus pol sci is established. however, i've kind of always wanted ntu ppga  even if ntu hass is not as established (based on rankings, ppl's opinion's, employers' view etc) could anyone pls advice us? Hello, third year PPGA student here. Basically, second major and double major are the same. When you are guaranteed second major, it means you can declare your choice of second major in your first/second year of study. How it works is that, NTU HSS students will only be invited to take up a second major if their CGPA is at least 4.0/5.0, ie, you need a minimum of second upper honours after your first year to receive the faculty\u2019s invitation. So guaranteed second major would probably mean that you need not meet the requirement of 4.0 to do a second major. There several considerations for you to decide between FASS and PPGA. If I\u2019m not wrong, for FASS, you declare your major after your common year in the first year. For NTU SSS/SoH, your offer is your first major and you begin taking your major\u2019s compulsory introductory modules in your very first semester.  For FASS, you have the option of graduating with a pass degree after your 3rd year should you not wish to do your honours (you need to do a thesis to qualify for honours). For NTU, its direct-honours, meaning the total duration of your degree is 4-years (including your FYP). However, direct honours does NOT mean guaranteed honours. In other words, if your GPA is screwed up, you will end up with no honours even though your programme is 4-years. Hope this helps!"},

Oh yes, as PPGA is a relatively new course (only 5 years-old), FASS is definitely more established than HSS. May I know why you always wanted PPGA over Pol science? PPGA, as its name suggests, is more geared towards public policy and public administration. Having said that, there is also a \u201cglobal affairs\u201d component where you can also choose to \u201cspecialise\u201d in international relations modules. But if you are a more political philosophy person, it is recommended that you choose Philosophy or go to NUS Pol Science because PPGA offers limited modules in that area. I have peers who are on the PA/PP track where generally do not take IR modules (other than compulsory ones). Vice versa, there are those who are the GA track and generally avoid PA/PP modules lol. Of course, you can also have a combination, depending on your interest. As for career and employment, majority of my seniors in PPGA joined the public service, mostly in ministries and statutory boards including MFA, MOF, MOM, MTI, MOE. Name it and you have it lol. Also there are a handful that went to the media industry joining CNA/SPH as journalists.  Ultimately, your grades and attitude will determine how far you go in life. I believe the civil service recognises your degree regardless whether you are from NUS/NTU/SMU. Most importantly, do well in your academic studies as civil service is extremely stringent in their selection for fresh graduates!"},

Having a double major might pull down my GPA, since I need to focus on more modules (but if you\u2019re really smart and hardworking then go for it!)

Additionally, I think it\u2019s quite key to know when to speak and when to listen. Listening can sometimes help you to see the bigger picture/better structure your thoughts. By extension, listening can help you to contribute more meaningfully to the conversation. This in a sense, also exhibits your intellectual temperament.  Bottom line: Be yourself, but be your emotionally and intellectually intelligent self. I went for the interview yesterday and I felt that it was more of a group discussion rather than an interview! I think I spoke okay but uncertain if I would be accepted or not "},

Hopefully someone can clarify my doubts! Hi!!! First of all: congrats for getting NTU Psych!! As for the double major--I think NTU will give you a list of majors you can take alongside psych! If soci is one of them u should take it! As for workload, I'm pretty sure it's going to be quite a lot. But if you have the passion for it I think you should be able to handle it--but play your cards right. You can always do post-grad (if you want to). As for the comparison between FASS, you should look at the modules offered in NTU and NUS. For soci, at least, I preferred NTU's curriculum!"},

No, you don't have to bring your cert, but I brought along magazines which contain my written articles and took opportunity to show the prof.  My advice is if you are accepted, you must have some interest in history to take up this course. As mentioned, very heavy readings and lots of writing of essays.

I'm just really worried because I'm a poly student and obviously haven't really touched history as a subject in awhile, (other than some current affairs/history-related reading material and the O Levels which was ages ago) so I really hope I get in because I may not get any other offers!!

Is that overdress or what's to be expected? (I don't get why the email even said smart casual, but I just followed the email...) NTU and NUS completely ignoring me forever. I've gotten so depressed I'm no longer depressed. Perhaps this is one way of curing yourself of depression: where everything becomes a delusion and nothing in life matters anymore. It sucks that everything to form a judgment on someone can just be based on a single event on a single day and nothing else, but well, that's life. You can say there's still time but I just can't take waiting up to 3 agonizing more months later. If anything, the only realistic thing in life that will ever happen is me writing that appeal letter. Before your comments get lost in the sea of comments on this very active forum, let me reply to your rant/concerns. I just want to say that I get you. I totally do. Why? I was once in your position last year. Unknowingly fell into depression during the waiting period from April to May because I waited hopelessly for things that eventually (and obviously) did not come true... Exactly 1 year ago on this date (13 April 2017), I received a devastating offer from NTU \u2014 environmental engineering, and that was my last choice. It was supposed to be a celebration, that I received an offer, but it was the absolute last thing I wanted, since it wasn't my first choice, and something that I knew I couldn't accept doing (and was stupid enough to even place it in my choices, ah well).  Subsequently I got rejected by NUS and SMU, because I simply didn't make the cut... With a heavy heart I signed up (late) for private A levels, and as much as I hated the idea of having to retake, having to suffer... I had no choice. I really wanted to prove to myself that I CAN get into local uni. It didn't help when I'm from one of the top JCs, and my friends are moving on happily to overseas unis with unconditional offers, scholarships, or medicine, law, dentistry... you name it. I was utterly alone. And I felt like I was the only loser in my school (and also a disgrace to my school) who had to retake A levels, who couldn't really make the cut for local uni. In the end, ALL my appeals failed. What's new? Reality slapped me hard in the face, and it hurt like a bitch, of course. What could I do? I had to move on. I then spent some time correcting my mindset before I was actually more mentally stable for my exams. But I just have to tell you that you are really doing yourself a huge disfavour right now. Yes you are disappointed, you are not receiving news, everything seems oh so damn hopeless. But self pity will only kill you, as well as the people around you who love and care for you... do know that YOU are not the only one suffering, your family and friends are too! Everything seems bleak right now yes, but once you get that offer, everything will be merry and bright...  For me, I knew that I wanted to go to uni. I spent that one more year not just preparing for retake, but also redefining my goals and aspirations in my life. Also, building on my character. Depression no more! There were many sacrifices made, many times that I felt like hiding in a cave... but I overcame that and grew so much stronger. As long as you YEARN it, you will get it no matter what, because no one can stop you!! So don't even let the demons in your head stop you, please do not give in to depression. No one can help you except yourself. I suggest you try meditation and yoga, those things saved my ass (': And here I am back this year, legitly exactly one year later. I received my offer from NTU business...... It took one more year, but it was so worth it. Although my story might not be the most impressive one, but I've proved to everyone and most importantly myself that if I want something, I'm gonna make sure I get it, even if it means one year later. Because this is my future, and I am the captain of my ship of fate. I hope that you realise this too, be proud of who you are, of your battlescars, failures and experiences. All these will shape you into who you are \u2014 a better you. Chin up!! "},

That post which u posted literally does NOTHING for you, but perhaps a few encouragement replies from friendly netizens. I know its tough, but instead of feeling sorry for yourself, channel that energy into something positive, productive. You got rejected for business or whatever right. Move on, start thinking what you CAN do instead of leaving things up to fate and worrying over things you cant control. If business is your end goal, start thinking of alternatives; for example maybe taking economica or an arts course but majoring in business and then perhaps appealing for transfer etc, or writing that appeal letter. You can make life alot harder for yourself by focusing on the negative stuff, or to make an excuse for why things didnt go your way. Learn from them, its a choice, YOUR choice. Dont victimize yourself, learn from them and be the best version of yourself. Wisdom is knowing what you CAN control and what you CANT control"},

I\u2019m pretty sure ranking is quite important, I had consulted professors from NUS/SMU during their openhouse, and they told me that a person that rank it first choice (despite having a lower score, will get priority over someone who ranks it second choice)!

Feels weird to feel slightly hopeful for an offer but I ain't receiving anything. Anxiety be the death of me (\u00d7\u032f\u00d7) Thanks! I guess they do look at your CCA record and leadership as well! and maybe even individual grades of your H2/H1s. Bc i have a friend who got the same RP as me but not offered yet, don\u2019t lose hope yet! theres always appeal after the first window. Good luck!!"},

People themselves can't just reliably evaluate their own performance relevant to what the profs may be looking for. Some that think they did poorly ended up getting accepted, while those that think they did OK end up waiting without any offers yet.  If you belong to the latter, it is worrisome indeed since it could either mean your application is just processing or you've downright been rejected. Of course there's the 2nd application window, but by then it's like a 50/50 chance it seems. I don't know how many smart high-flyers would choose NUS/NTU/overseas over SMU."},

If you are taking 2 separate majors that are completely different, it means the modules won't overlap and you will be taking many many modules.

For example Economics and Management complements each other and really boost your cv but Accounting and Business is like 1 Specific 1 General (for Singapore Unis in my opinion) so i don't really see a point tbh haha.

Congrats on getting all your offers. Since distance is not an issue for either one , I suggest you do more research and gather more opinions online or offline regarding both schools about their teaching style , modules , examinations etc etc. Usually for Singaporeans they will all just flock to NUS due to the ranking (not forgetting our \u201clegendary\u201d Plow98 promoter comparing NUS - Mercedes to NTU- Toyota) ,but I just want to say rankings is not everything , if not people won\u2019t go overseas to study since NUS and NTU is quite high up the table in world rankings. Even some PSC scholars go to overseas universities lower ranked than NUS&NTU (you can check up their annual reports online).  Either way , you won\u2019t go wrong with either Universities if you are just looking to stay and work in Singapore. Just find the uni that suits you and I wish you all the best."},

{"name": "valhallaX", "message": "flatron13 wrote:  Plow98, you seem to think that computing is a good course. However, I have to pop your bubble. Computing is not a good course. Computing has always been shunned by students in the past. 1 of the main reason is because computing is on the cutting edge of technology and it becomes obsolete very quickly. You may have seen the recent graduate salary survey that ranks computing as 1 of the highest starting pay for fresh grads. This is a little odd, as there are no shortage of computing grads in Singapore. The intake for computing students has always been huge in Singapore. If so, why is there a demand for these fresh grads? This is because many of those earlier graduates have become obsolete and there is a constant demand for fresh blood. This also means that you will become obsolete very quickly after you have graduated. It also means that the career ceiling tends to be very low. I think that the recent push by the govt to promote computing will end up like their failure in pushing biomedical sciences. #hard truths. Up for this and adding on to what Flatron mentioned. CS course has existed way far back and it was infamous for being a dumping ground for prospective undergrad students  Not to mention the typical stereotype/stigma that comes with it, eg. People think you fix computer when you say you study CS.  Worst if they ask you to help fix their computer when there is a problem (not troubleshooting btw, is hardware problem). People in the IT department always got called by other department to help fix other not so IT related stuffs like aircon not working, printer not working & etc  This is what IT is like before all this hype LOL. nyarlathotepia wrote:  That's true. Anyone planning to enter CS should be keen on life-long learning. I notice that some of my peers just hope to graduate with a Bachelor's, get a good job, and go onto autopilot. People like this don't suit computing because even the undergrad modules are already outdated. It really takes passion to keep up with new developments and talent/hard work to make sure one is up to par with industry standards, plus personal projects and so on. It takes way more than that tbh if you want to continue stay in this industry ... normally people who graduated, after a few years of working they will get married and start a family. Where to find the time to constantly catch up on the industry standards (unless you intend to stay single for your whole life to focus on your career), that's when the company starts looking for 'Fresh Blood' kicks in. Normally people in CS will end up in a managerial role later in their life, as the career path for CS students are really limited and remain stagnant after sometime. So it boils down to whether or not is it worth the trouble to go for this course when you are gonna end up competing for a management role with other people who has a degree in management. But of course, a manager with a CS background will be well-loved by the IT people. Why? Because the manager is then well aware of how ridiculous some of the request coming out from some other people from other department are and therefore they can step in to help better adjust the project delivery schedule.  And that, I think is why people kept saying to go for this course only if you really have the passion in learning what this course offers "},

With the effect of a new curriculum in nus in 2017, you will be allowed direct entry to 2nd major and minor. Basically for major and minor u take courses from ur unrestrictice elective module. (If you don't take minor and major you just take uem courses that seems interesting for you like a language like Korean or music. Uem basically means you can take any course in nus you want.  But if you do take major or minor u take courses related to your minor or major under the uem. Different between major and minor simply means major u take more mods).

(\u3065\uff61\u25d5\u203f\u203f\u25d5\uff61)\u3065 Although I'm not too sure myself, I think a double major just means that you take two majors, but when you graduate, only a single degree appears on the scroll. So I think it will be Bachelor of Business (Hons) with CNM, instead of a double degree which I think should be Bachelor of Business (Hons) & Bachelor of Social Science (omg I'm not too sure about this ah haha). Hope this helps!! And content wise double degree needs 5 years to complete while double major should just be 4 if I'm not wrong!! Difference is in the number of modules you take (-:"},

But i do know of peopple getting shortlisted for interview thereafter getting the offer for the scholarship so then I emailed the administration office and they told me they are still processing with the scholarship applications and they told me AS OF NOW I have not been shorlisted for the interview YET.

Anecdotal evidence adds very little to discussion - as you will learn in university. You can't just dismiss the importance of O's with your personal experience. I suspect the fall in accountancy admission criteria is due to the increased local university options for accountancy (ie.

If you look back at last year's thread, people were waiting right up to June/July, and there could be NO response at all, not even rejection, even though hopes are slim by then.  You were granted an interview. You prepared hard for the interview. Just because your friends got offers you did, you are now so depressed that you want to jump off the window. You also implied that even those who supposedly screw up their interviews will get an offer. Have you thought that maybe yours is just taking a longer time to process?  I did not get a single response from SMU until late June, even though everyone knows you don't stand a single chance with SMU if you don't get an interview. I could have held onto a single strand of hope that a miracle might happen, or accept the fact I am not to be with SMU, and move on with life.  There are many worst off than you, and while I am not going to doubt your pain and feelings, I hope you see that you are simply imposing unnecessary due stress on yourself. I understand that everyone is anxious here and have different coping mechanisms, but honestly people, IT IS STILL EARLY.  You can come into the thread and ask who got offers already, you can compare with your friends - but what good does it do if you just don't hear back from your universities?  Yes, we can assume by the second acceptance window that chances for an offer is low, but we are NOT EVEN CLOSE. That's in June. We are in early April. Everyone has their trajectory in this waiting game, similarly in life, as we move on from here with acceptances or rejections.  How are you guys going to make it through the remaining months of waiting?  Just a food for thought.  kthxbye. I totally agree with this. While I understand that you (@muryaz) are very anxious now, I just think that you are adding unnecessary stress and anxiety to yourself. During this crucial waiting period, the worst thing you can do to yourself is becoming overly anxious and depressed because of comparisons with your friends. It is inevitable to compare, but just focus on yourself. I was once in your position last year, and the (hopeless) waiting period took a huge toll on my mental health and yes, I ultimately got depressed. Although I'm okay now, I really just think that it's NOT worth it to let your mental health go through this huge dip just because of uni admissions.

Sorry but that's how Singapore education system is, it all boils down to that one exam to determine how well you do and how study-smart you can be for that exam. No use complaining but to suck it up. Alternatively you may reconsidering taking O/ A level specific subjects. My friend retook O level English."},

Regardless whether you have accepted/enrolled in other universities, NUS will still process your application and inform you of the outcome between late April and May (those who have attended test/interviews for Architecture, Industrial Design, Law, Medicine, Dentistry and Nursing will receive their outcome in May). If you have received an offer from another university while awaiting your application outcome from NUS, you may wish to approach the other university to extend your acceptance deadline. Students who are enrolled elsewhere while awaiting the outcome of their application to NUS are advised to check with their institution on the terms and conditions for fee payment and withdrawal should they choose to matriculate at NUS.

Oh dear I don't think your family knows business as a course really well? It's not really correct to say that \"you're not going to learn anything\" and it definitely is beyond common sense (since it's a degree for a reason haha), but I do understand their viewpoint, aka you don't necessarily need a business degree to venture into business in the future, but it doesn't mean that one cannot take up a business degree right! As for your choices, hmm I feel that sciences and business aren't really related, so I advice you to go for what you truly like (which seems to be science!). I understand your worry now as you are not hearing news from NUS/NTU but just wait it out abit longer since it's still early April! If you don't mind sharing may I know your RP? If you've qualified for science then I'm pretty sure you would get it! And here are my two cents on why I want business! It's honestly a personal choice, so it differs from person to person. But for me, I am interested in business because it is very versatile and general. Some people don't like a degree that's too general and like to be more specialised (like med and dentistry LOL), but I am a generalist and I feel that the whole structure of business would really suit me. I am not exactly strongly strongly passionate about business (in fact I would gladly want to avoid banking or finance tracks because I don't think I will like them haha) but I am just fine with it, and there are modules that really interest me like entrepreneurship, etc. Basically I chose business because I can really see myself in it, and that's really important too!

Surely if the uni is going to consider you for all 5 choices applied for, then the application processing period will take longer if you don't make the cut for the 1st..then 2nd...then 3rd...and so forth It is possible if you think logically! Because the unis would have accepted you right away if they wanted you (for e.g. those with high RP). But it might also be because of the overwhelming number of applications they have to deal with! But yes there is a possibility that your application is being passed down your choices, hence it is taking a longer time."},

It's their job to handle enquires; even though they may not be able to resolve your issues. For you, the call will be an active move addressing your anxiety. Psychologically, it will be good to distress yourself and satisfied that you have done all you could. Better than waiting in total silence, when your peers are on the move.

Because you're an international student. High chance you will be rejected. If you read last year's thread, some international student with low 80s was rejected from NTU EEE.

I am sure they can either have access to all our results or they will later request for our additional submissions. We have already received acknowledgement of our acceptances stating clearly our degree programmes (home courses), under our names / NRICs.

I think we should wait for NUS Admission Office to initiate moves for us to submit the final semester result, if necessary.

We have already received acknowledgement of our acceptances stating clearly our degree programmes (home courses), under our names / NRICs. In this acknowledgement, there was no mention of 'conditional' in any form or inference.  Initiating any unilateral moves on our part with the said application portal risk messing up with things we may not fully understand. Just believe Admission Office and settle down to wait.

Usually appeals would be successful if for example the applicant changes their mind and chooses to switch to another course but provided that his/her rp meets the 10th percentile IGP for both courses. This is just my opinion so take it with a pinch of salt (-: But because of my past experience I can really say it's true that there is veryyyy little chance of successful appeals, because if the course wanted to accept you they would have done so in the first place.

I do know some who picked NTU over NUS simply because they were offered a scholarship. It can be a huge pull factor. I'm an NTU third year student. I have peers who are Nanyang scholars. The scholarship is very attractive, you are funded for ALL your fees, exchange programme, guaranteed hall stay. Its extremely difficult to be awarded Nanyang scholarship and these scholars are usually your dean listers."},

But the 40% can be achieved through the places from other newer university such as SUSS or SIT.  By doing so, are they doing it by  increasing the class size or cohort size(through having more class)?  The two strategy gives different outcome to the quality of education which the student will recieve."},

{"name": "scholar88", "message": "weilxxn wrote:  Hi, in my opinion, for Business, employers are looking for students who are outgoing and are able to step out of their comfort zone. SMU will be the place to ensure that students are vocal with the emphasis on class participation. As a person who is not outgoing, i am trying to force myself out of my comfort zone.  From what i have researched, NTU/NUS have a more laid back culture which is not going to help me improve at all.  At the end of the day, employers doesn't look at the university that you are from or the ranking that you university have. They look at you. Your soft skills and hard skills are the things that matter the most. SMU Business also have the highest income when compared to the others. Most of us who entered university hopes to achieve a higher income in the future isn't it? Therefore, this would be the ideal choice for me. Not really leh. I browse thru smu modules. Most modules class participation only 10% of total marks, which is similar to NTU/NUS. For some modules,  for participation component, it only require you to do some pre lecture quizzes only.. So i feel that not necessary class participation comprises a lot in SMU. All uni still require you to participate in class, I guess? In conclusion, in depends on lecturer on how they want to allocate the marks for the different components (Quiz, Exam, Grp Proj, Tutorial, etc). Some lecturer may emphasise on class part, some not. Depends on lecturer and the overall school. Some say SMU has a lot of grp project, but being in Nus, almost all the modules also require grp project. So I feel no difference. Probably is their concept of lecture and tutorial which is seminar based, compulsory internship, compulsory community work, compulsory overseas programme, is what attracts employers. Hence for the class part/grp project or being outspoken, I dont really see any diff in all schools. You can still not contribute any inputs during class in smu, and still graduate. Depends on your own personality I feel, nobody can change you if u dont want to. But it is still a fact that employer value smu students compared to the other schools."},

Could be the opening of new universities, the falling birth rates, or just a general grade deflation as possible factors too.  Thanks! Really didnt expect myself to get in though was just applying for the sake of it. Nope gotta serve my NS first, will be enrolling in 2020 I guess."},

I guess that's because A level was meant as a stepping stone to move on to further studies into Universities whereas Singapore Diplomas' was meant as a track into the working world (last time when degree wasn't the norm.) already. Hence, they didn't set out any standards but when applying overseas, they do look both into modules and gpa.

{"name": "Plow98", "message": "KeroMax wrote:  It's not just internship. I personally don't feel the entire concept of GPA across diploma and courses is directly comparable. Unlike A levels where everyone takes the same paper. In polytechnic, every institution is different, every diploma is different. A gpa of 3.8 in Course X may not be directly comparable to Course Y. Some courses top student is 3.99, other course top student only 3.7. Some diploma with merit is 3.8 cut off, some 3.6 cut off.  There is no standard across. I beg to differ.  Each and every poly course has to be presented (multiple sessions) by your poly ( by school director, programme chair and poly lecturers) to a panel of assessors from / at the university. The uni panels are formed by profs and admission professionals. (All Big 3 at least). The presenters are interviewed and their submissions examined / compared to other similar courses from other polytechnics. Submissions include course curriculum, course work, exam papers and assessment standard used, lab work, IG work, past internship records, etc.  On site assessments of poly teaching facilities are included.  Only then, universities may consider to grant: (1) accreditation for the course - without which the student need not even apply; (2) advanced standing for the course; (3) exemptions from some specialisation modules This information for poly courses can be found in the annual IGP listing.  Not all poly courses made the list. [Upon receiving your admission application, this is the first thing checked or filtered out by the online admission software.] Continued status (and scrutiny) of the course at the university depends on the performance of admitted undergrads from that poly course.  ========= Diploma with Merits are not solely based on cgpa. CCA, non-academic achievements, industry certifications, etc are considered as well. Amituofo"},

You'll write an essay first relating to do the article(s) they provided you with, then you'll do a cognitive test - both of these were done on computer.

Finally, you'll be interviewed by the faculty which you put as your top choice - I don't know why, but I was interviewed by 2 professors from the social work faculty. They asked me questions mostly on \"Why Social Work? What do you think Social Work entails? Did you apply to any other unis?

Also, don't forget to bring up whatever CCA/external achievements you have and show them that you truly deserve the course. I'll share a little of my experience: So I was talking about how social work was not just about helping people but that you have to be mentally stable as people will see you as their emotional crutch. Then they asked me about what else I thought Social Work was and what policy I would look at to change and I was just stumped there but I went on to talk about the situation with children and I kind of teared up a little cuz I told them about the problems I have with my younger sis. I honestly thought I screwed up my individual interview, but whatever happens to you in the interview, just keep talking and don't lose your train of thought because it will really kill you to sit in silence. So, research research research! As for when I'll receive the offer, I don't know how long I gotta wait but my friend who went for the interview in Feb received her offer in approximately a months' time after her interview.

I was working under contract for the 1 gap year as a support/customer service before moving into the admin support and then I resigned end Feb this year to focus on my uni applications.

We also got a Silver Award at the Singapore International Choral Festival 2015 and my JC recognized my efforts with awards for leadership and team (merit and distinction respectively).

A job at Watson's may be useful for an aspiring pharmacy undergraduate, but medicine is a bit of a stretch. And admissions do look upon community service quite favourably.  An arrogant and defensive doctor will have a tough residency, I'd say.

It's me again lolol I took A levels in 2016 and took a gap year after my application to the Big Three unis backfired - I really regret not listening to my mum's advice on getting my tutor to write an appraisal for me, but this year, I asked one of my tutors and I was so thankful that she put the time and effort to write one for me! Anyway, I'm here to get my chances rated in getting into uni this year. I noticed some of the COP increased and decreased across the Big Three. These are my grades: A for PW, B for GP, BDD/B for my 3H2 1H1 (subject combi is MPC/E) and pass in MTL B. I was working under contract for the 1 gap year as a support/customer service before moving into the admin support and then I resigned end Feb this year to focus on my uni applications. If it helps, I can also give info on my CCA/extra-curricular contributions: I was Student Conductor when I was in my JC's choir, and we did some voluntary works - once at an old aged home and another with single parents and their kids. We also got a Silver Award at the Singapore International Choral Festival 2015 and my JC recognized my efforts with awards for leadership and team (merit and distinction respectively). I'm aiming for either NTU's English/History/Philosophy/NIE Arts Education or NUS FASS. I know my RP is very borderline, but I want to know what are my chances. I also filled up all DA components for all the unis and even applied for SIT and SUSS. Would appreciate the advice from you guys!"},

So what if you are higher than me when my GPA is way higher than yours?  Allow me to repeat myself: Your GPA has a 80% weightage and your O'Level results is only 20%.  For that, I can also look down on your for having such a lousy GPA, but I wouldn't because I don't have to.  I would not know whether you will definitely fail, in fact I would dare say until a decision is made, you always stand a chance. However, you first come into this forum asking people to rate your chances, so here's how many of us rated: impossible. If you are here to seek for comfort and encouragement, you are at the wrong place.  To even get a chance at an interview, you must be shortlisted in the first place. Again, many of us do not think that your GPA is enough to get called up for an interview. Your \"hard work and sheer determination\" would not be able to get NUS Medicine to shortlist you for an interview, because that decision is beyond your control. Besides, you are in no position to judge for yourself whether your answers are solid or not, just like your grades. It is up to Medicine. #justsaying Again, would your pharmacist friends get you into NUS Medicine? No. Dude, even if your Dad is Lee Hsien Loong, he may not even be able to guarantee you a spot in Medicine, because that would be abusing his power.  Given that you are so optimistic, I understand that it may be hard for you to take such hard truths in a day. However, I hope it gets to you that your GPA is really abysmal even for the less popular courses in the local universities, and prepare alternative routes for yourself, such as going overseas for Medicine, or taking A'Levels as a private candidate. Edit: Just to add, I am already an undergraduate at NTU, so no I am not competing against you for a place. If you deem anyone who did not get L1R5 of 8 or below as worthy of talking to you, kindly just seek for advice/encouragement/self-affirmation elsewhere. Thank you. Yes to add on to what you have said even if your father is a doctor doesn't guarantee you a spot in NUS Medicine.  The interview is so strict that you have to be assessed by another invigilator doctor if you know the previous doctor (before you are transferred to other circuit) to ensure fairness to all students."},

Forgot to mention that I actually work as a sales assistant in Watson and made two pharmacist friends there. Oh dear, seems like you still do not get all of our points. Okay you've been preparing hard for the interview, but the main point here is, no matter how harsh it might sound, you will NOT secure an interview with medicine. Singapore works like this, no grades, no say. My friend scored all A's for her A levels except for an unfortunate B in her KI. She applied for NUS medicine but did NOT manage to secure an interview, although she had an excellent portfolio (with leadership + exco). Do you see how hard and competitive it is to get into medicine?? After today's fiasco, there's still no conclusion. Most people would know by now that no chance means no chance at all. Similarly like what the people above had said, if your GPA was at least a 3.5 and above, we might say that you stand a small chance. I take back my words about your 'positivity', I genuinely doubt it now... I can only conclude that you are delusional and unrealistic and refuse to admit that you are not going to make it into medicine. Honestly, what's the point now by mentioning and being bitter about your O level results? Does that result slip make your chances into medicine slightly easier, by chance...? It's just like how an A level student with 60RP but argues, \"But I scored a 280 for my PSLE! And I was from an IP school!\". The only thing that matters for uni admission is A level results or poly GPA results. The world is harsh and realistic. You either admit defeat and grow and learn from it, or refuse to move on.

Miracles really do not happen in life. Yes, I believe you that hard work and dedication can bring you to far and amazing places. But you asked us to rate your chance for medicine, and we can all say that it's impossible just based off your poly results alone. We are no one to judge your academic performance in poly, but you do admit it's not up to par with the requirement needed for medicine, right? You really need to recognise that first, that using your poly results and even your O's will NOT get you into medicine. Like you said, hard work and dedication can bring you to your destination, but not this avenue... Maybe if you redo poly, or take A levels as a private candidate, or take BMAT and go overseas med... these are other avenues that you can consider. I really admire your positive outlook, as I was once in your position (not for medicine but for another course). I was told \"delusional\", \"silly\", \"stupid\" by many others. And obviously, my application to my desired uni course failed. That was when I received a huge slap from reality (and had to go through the pain of retaking A levels. etc). And I am sure you do not want this to come. Still, I wish you all the best in your future endeavours. With your never-say-die attitude, I'm sure you can go far in life, really.

If you had worked as hard in poly, your GPA shouldn't be that bad. I'm not putting you down. I'm being realistic here buddy.  I had a grand total of 24 points for my L1R4 and 33 points for my L1R5. That didn't even allow me to get into ITE. To get into local uni, it was clear there were 2 paths. Redo my O levels, then go poly for 3 years or do my A levels as a private candidate. I took option number 2, worked my ass off while also juggling a full time job and scored well enough for NUS to accept me in spite of my abysmal O level results. So yeah, call me a wet blanket but I already highlighted the paths for you to take if medicine is truly your dreams. If you want to prove me wrong, take your A levels, score AAA/AA and NUS medicine will be happy to take you in . Banking on your 2.5 GPA is not the way. DA is not a magical entry into local unis. You do need reasonable grades to be considered and outstanding achievements RELEVANT to your course of study. Someone obviously didn't want to be realistic with you when they told you that you stand a good chance of entering medicine. Is there a chance? Yes but a very very very small chance. As I mentioned, if you want to save lives, there are other options like being a paramedic or being a nurse. Why so fixated on being a doctor? I rather be a \"wet blanket\" but realistic knowing it's better for you than give you false hope."},

Allow me to break it down for you.  1) It appears to me from your various posts that you are still hung up over your L1R5 of 6. I am here to remind you that your O'Level results constitute only 20% for your admission, the other is 80% from your GPA. Your GPA is currently 2.5, whereas we all know Medicine only accepts those with straight A's for A'Levels, and the 10th percentile for poly kids is 3.91.  Therefore, your O'Level results of 6 is NOTHING in comparison to those who have 3.91 for their GPA, and most likely have equally good or if not at least single digit L1R5 scores.  2) Quoting this particular post by you, I am also here to remind you that NUS/NTU is not admitting you based on you being 2nd in your clique, but you are competing against EVERYONE else who applied for a place in the entire Singapore. No one cares how well you do relative to your friends - it is how well you do relative to the entire nation.  3) You insist you have organised many camps and events in polytechnic. You may try to apply under the Exceptional Individual Scheme (EIS) (their form of DA) for NUS if you deem it sufficient enough for you to enter Medicine. Nevertheless, do bear in mind that your service to your school/course is not as valuable as say, someone who chose to volunteer in an area that is related to Medicine. For example, working at the pharmacy, volunteering simple first aid services to the elderly in need/staying alone.  4) Universities does not taking into consideration your past in NS, because JC kids who got in would be training to be medical doctors to serve in NS anyway.  You asked for people to rate your chances, and just because many rated it as very low or even impossible, you call people a wet blanket. If anything, you ought to know that prospective Medicine students have to go through 8 rounds of interview (last heard from a year 3 med student herself) to get in, each testing for different values in you. You are not showing me that you are able to take constructive feedback and given the competitiveness of the places for Medicine, you would most likely have failed the interview, if you even get called up.  I hope you see that your chances are as good as impossible, simply because anyone with a GPA of below 3 would NOT stand a chance for ANY courses in ANY local university. Universities admit based on grades, that's why they have a IGP, and very little on your CCA. Heck, even the Ivy League universities who are considerably more open with their admissions policies still have a minimum baseline for SAT results.

If his GPA was 3.7+ range, I would tell him the chances are very slim but if he had achievements relevant to his course of study (hospital attachments etc.), that may help him. 2.5 GPA is abysmal. People with 3.4 GPA are fighting to get into \"low demand\" courses like NTU English and this guy with a 2.5 GPA thinks he can get into the most in demand course in Singapore? As I mentioned, I myself fugged up my O levels but if I had asked people to rate my chances of entering RJC with 33 points, do you think people would have said \"there's a chance?\" Hell no. They would have laughed, told me to go into ITE instead. This scenario is similar to his situation. NUS medicine is RJC and he pretty much has 33 points and trying to enter RJC. What am I supposed to say? If he truly wanted to enter, there are alternatives. I have made it clear along with others. If die-die want to enter NUS medicine, prepare to slog hard for A levels."},

Meatboi96  Just My 2 Cents: I would like to tell you good luck but sometimes its good to take a step back and absorb all the comments in the forums. I don't think that they're trying to be a 'wet blanket' to pull you down but trying to process  some thoughts. From your comments you seemed like a confident person but maybe a little hung onto your past, you may have scored well during O lvls for L1R4 but maybe things happen which caused you to not do well. However consoling yourself that you're the second of your clique doesn't seem to me as a good mindset as you're just limiting yourself. (Staying in your comfort zone.)  Maybe you can try studying for SATs and A lvls for next year or maybe for when you ORD like little by little during the weekends or something. It could be helpful  And you don't have to challenge me about my grades i scored 2.1 G.P.A during poly hahaha Honestly wish you the best for your application "},

I have been preparing for the medical interview intensively and I believe my answers are really solid. Forgot to mention that I actually work as a sales assistant in Watson and made two pharmacist friends there. Still being so passive aggressive.  Why do you have to keep pointing out that your L1R5 is higher than most of the users here? So what if you are higher than me when my GPA is way higher than yours?  Allow me to repeat myself: Your GPA has a 80% weightage and your O'Level results is only 20%.  For that, I can also look down on your for having such a lousy GPA, but I wouldn't because I don't have to.  I would not know whether you will definitely fail, in fact I would dare say until a decision is made, you always stand a chance. However, you first come into this forum asking people to rate your chances, so here's how many of us rated: impossible. If you are here to seek for comfort and encouragement, you are at the wrong place.  To even get a chance at an interview, you must be shortlisted in the first place. Again, many of us do not think that your GPA is enough to get called up for an interview. Your \"hard work and sheer determination\" would not be able to get NUS Medicine to shortlist you for an interview, because that decision is beyond your control. Besides, you are in no position to judge for yourself whether your answers are solid or not, just like your grades. It is up to Medicine. #justsaying Again, would your pharmacist friends get you into NUS Medicine? No. Dude, even if your Dad is Lee Hsien Loong, he may not even be able to guarantee you a spot in Medicine, because that would be abusing his power.  Given that you are so optimistic, I understand that it may be hard for you to take such hard truths in a day. However, I hope it gets to you that your GPA is really abysmal even for the less popular courses in the local universities, and prepare alternative routes for yourself, such as going overseas for Medicine, or taking A'Levels as a private candidate. Edit: Just to add, I am already an undergraduate at NTU, so no I am not competing against you for a place. If you deem anyone who did not get L1R5 of 8 or below as worthy of talking to you, kindly just seek for advice/encouragement/self-affirmation elsewhere. Thank you."},

You can\u2019t really \u201cretake\u201d poly as an examination as it\u2019s culmative GPA.   I can see that you are trying to ignore the negative response here which is good , but also try to understand from their point of view in terms of knowing that generally your gpa really stands no chance of studying medicine in Singapore unless you take the A Level examination (and yes I agree Local uni here are more biased with JC but no choice , doesn\u2019t mean Poly students can\u2019t enter Local Uni also) FYI , don\u2019t really need to work hard to become officer unless you are saying you wayang your way through haha . Just be humble and chill ~ All the best !"},

May you be well and happy. tbh, based on ur GPA, it is going to be a rly tough journey for u even if u got accepted into med. it is gonna be v competitive. There's a limit whr passion and hard work can bring u, u need to have v strong determination and a proper goal to work towards to in order to finish the degree without giving up. Just curious, why do you want to be a doctor?  Anyways, if u are really set on applying for med, go ahead. U can try and get testimonials from your teachers/med-related acquaintances, it helps. I know someone who had gpa 3.4+ getting into med, as he had acquaintances (from his volunteering organisation who are lecturers at med sch) writing testimonials for him.  However, he dropped out from the course after 1 year as it was too tough for him.  All the best to you,  hope u really gave this proper thoughts. Anyways u have NS right?  can always just try again next yr "},

I don't see many poly grads on this forum complaining about unfairness between poly/JC grads... In fact, there are more poly grads receiving their uni offers than JC grads for now, because the application for JC kids just ended. I don't see why this is a problem, esp when the intake for poly grads into local uni has increased over the years. I think there is not much difference between a poly/JC graduate when it comes to grades/CGPA... I scored really badly for A levels back in 2016 and was unable to enrol in a local uni. It's a matter of hard work in your respective placing, really. Undoubtedly there are some discriminations between JC and poly, but I genuinely feel that hard work can bring you places. Honestly, there are so many of my friends (I was from an elite JC) with perfect portfolios and >87.5RP but they are still struggling to get into med, both local and overseas. It's a tough struggle, I would advice you to be more realistic. Although I am personally not from poly, and neither do I have any friends from poly, but I just took a look at the IGP for all 3 schools and I don't think you'll be able to enrol in any uni course, let alone medicine...

NTU pros: - Direct entry to second year! - more focused on application and skills? (Not too sure how true this is..) - newer facilities? - less stressful and competitive compared to NUS? NTU cons: - So far! (And parents object to hall life  ) - less modules to select from - less reputable compared to nus?

I recall seeing a comment from a SMU Prof along the lines of - \"If you flip a coin to choose between NUS/NTU/SMU Business Programs, you'll be fine!\". I believe that all things being equal, that very much holds true. However, if I may, I'll like to provide a strategy using the next one week for A Level graduates to consider when ranking choices (Regardless of Major / University): Crash* the classes for the courses you're interested in. Why? 1. Open House events are like CNY. Whole campuses spruce up and show you the best they have to offer. However, its not very reflective of day to day life and you don't have extensive exposure to how classes are conducted. 2. By crashing classes, you figure out a few things that contribute to decision making: - How to travel from home to the destination faculty - Will it be a hassle to travel everyday (or for a 1.5 hr class when my travel time is 1.5 hrs x2) - Does the style of teaching / first impression of profs & faculty / general mood of students suit you  *In terms of crashing classes, I use the term loosely. I generally advise approaching your seniors / friends in faculties and programmes that you're interested in and request for their help in asking Profs for permission to audit (another term for sitting in) sectional classes of 30-50 pax.  For lectures, this is not necessary as attendance is generally not taken and there are too many students to take note of. I also haven't come across Profs that would reject requests from prospective students to audit classes as they still have to teach regardless of your presence! (i.e. you're just taking up an empty space and listening)   For NUS Business, feel free to approach me if you wish to audit classes to help in decision making, I'll be more than happy to liaise with Profs to help prospective students.

I\u2019m also a bit afraid that NUS hall life will take up too much of my time or that it\u2019ll be v hard to get into or continue staying in hall. Is NBS\u2019s 3 years direct honors worth? Some say its too rushed & you have lower starting pay bc of less internship experiences etc. but some say its more worth bc you can start work 1 year earlier etc. NTU has guaranteed freshmen 2 years of hall stay. So you'll only need to fight to get into hall for 1 year if you wish to"},

I was accepted by NUS and NTU last year so these are my observations. If things has changed or I'm wrong, don't hammer me  When your NUS applications status changes to \"YOUR APPLICATION HAS BEEN PROCESSED\", you should be able to login to the JAP portal after an hour and see your NUS offer there. But if you cannot login after a long long time, it's most likely you're rejected by NUS. Nevertheless, after 12 midnight, you will definitely be able to see the acceptance/rejection letters in NUS's portal. Those who are accepted should receive a SMS from NUS the next day too. My friend who was rejected (and ended in SIM ) told me he also received a snail mail from NUS to say sorry for the rejection.(Not sure if it's true) For second year NSF like me, you will receive another snail mail letter during September to ask you to reconfirm your choice.  For NTU, it's simpler. The moment you are accepted/rejected, you will receive an email from them to inform you that there's has been a change in your application status and from that instance you can login into NTU's portal to see the letter. NUS and NTU usually reject applicants in batches from late April onwards. Usually few dozens, or maybe hundreds will be slaughtered together. It is usually very messy. You can see the HWZ thread where several applicants with low GPAs jumping for joy and excitement that their NUS status changed to processed but after 12 midnight you don't see them anymore. Lol  So if your friend with GPA 2.5 and you with GPA 3.2 have the NUS portal changed to processed together and can't login to JAP,  it's probably you are given the privilege of being rejected together. Yay!!  Then they're these rare breeds who receives no news from NUS or NTU after the first window (24 May this year), it could be good news! You're probably placed in a waiting list. Those who did not take up the offer, you maybe up next for the spot and may receive an offer in the second acceptance window.  And yes! You can accept NUS or NTU first and if you are offered in the second window, your choice in the second window will supercede the choice in the first window! Uni application is a fun and exciting process and I wish everyone the best of luck! Was also accepted to both NTU and NUS last year and I think this post is a very accurate description!  To add on, if you applied for those popular interview courses like Med/Law, they can make you wait very long after your application to shortlist you for interview, and then after you\u2019ve gone for your tests/interview they will make you wait very long again. For NUS they do publicise their interview and test dates, so do take a look: http://www.nus.edu.sg/oam/apply/local/interviews/BYA-interviews.html If you don\u2019t receive any shortlist calls by those dates, most likely your chances for the course would be low. Otherwise they\u2019re quite fast at accepting people (especially if you have high RP) whether it be for your first choice or other subsequent choices. I\u2019m not entirely sure but if you\u2019re from Poly they might take longer and you might be getting your offers at the same time as the JC grads. Oh and they don\u2019t send snail mail if you\u2019re accepted, everything is over email/portal so do check your email regularly! Please don\u2019t flame if I turn out to be wrong, all these are based off my own experiences and that of my friends last year! Good luck to all "},

Anyone here can help me to differentiate which course will be better ? Information systems is more on E-commerce and Fin-Tech, leaning in towards the processes of business applied together with the skillset of IT. (For Poly Students, this is like Business IT) Computer Science is more for general development and understanding the inner-working of an algorithm/system, and from there being able to differentiate what makes an algorithm more robust and efficient.  Personally, I think Computer Science is better to go into. It is a broader scope and I personally feel unless you are truly interested in FinTech and want to go there to network with people in the industry, that you should try for Computer Science instead.  This is just my 2 cents. I am also applying this round, but though I worked my way up, still quite bleak for me to climb, so here's wishing you all the best! Anything do feel free to ask.

Thanks hello!! yes, application for NUS, NTU and SMU will close on 19 March. based on some of my friends' experiences, i don't think the uni will only review all applications after closing. one of my friends who applied to NTU accountancy received an offer 3 days after submitting her application. however i believe that the above scenario does not mean that it's on a first come first serve basis, but i definitely do think that the unis might offer those applicants with very outstanding rank points/GPA first, because if you think in the perspective of the unis, they would want to grab the more attractive students first because the students might not accept their offer. just my speculation though, but most people will start receiving their outcomes from end March onwards (-: if not, they are mostly early applicants, who applied way before A level results were released. hope this helps!!

Indication of specialisation usually takes place at the end of the 2nd year to the start of the 3rd year.  Students typically enroll for modules that together are worth from 18 to 24 MCs (i.e. about 5 to 6 modules) in a regular semester; more can be taken on exceptional basis.

Thank you in advance to anyone who replies! Depends on what major you are looking at. And lets ignore those straight As courses. For computing, it is extremely popular nowadays, due to the good career prospects and high starting pay. For this course, seems like there is an upward trend in the cut off point. For business/accountancy, it is also quite competitive. For this course, the cut off point has been stable over the years. Maybe for FASS, Science, Engineering courses, there is a slight chance.

But RE and Maritime is really very different, RE touches on urban planning, investment, valuation of property, asset management, etc. You should have some interest in property landscape in sg, real estate investment if you wish to take up this course. But for Maritime Studies,after graduation,  you will be employed as a Marine Operations Executive, Chartering Executive, Logistics Executive, Freight Forwarding Executive, Warehouse Planner. Mostly are key leadership roles in shore-based jobs. You should be interested in the local shipping industry if you would like to take up this course.

As a current student in MS, some of the challenges I saw are  1) most individuals do not know what which role suits them the best (eg Port Operations, Marine Insurance (underwriter), ship broker etc). There are multiple job prospect in the industry and it is all up to the individual to pursue depending on their personality and interests. Some may be more outspoken thus will go for brokering while some prefer operations which require strategic planning. 2) mandatory exchange to Norway (you can opt out if you really have a strong reason like financial issues) . Money is definitely an issue unless parents are rich. Most student who went for Norway will tell you its a beautiful country to be in, no doubt 3) competitive environment..but I think NBS is similar too. Most student during summer holiday chiong find internship and get various experience. Usually in ship management firm or ship brokering firm. Some student even full time study part time internship Other than these can't really think of any challenges.. Quite a chill course and most lectures are recorded unlike NBS. Saw your post on employment statistics, I personally think don't place to much emphasis on it la. If you are good in the course you studying, a lot employers are waiting to fight for you. If your result sucks then you are definitely at the lower end. Pay wise, MS quite standard. Always hear senior say low 3k. Anyway I also don't think starting pay is very important in the maritime industry. Most roles are commission based or includes allowance on top of basic which explains the low 3. Increment is frequent too. (all hear say one)  If you are from Polytechnic then maybe Math and statistics mod will be a huge barrier to you.  Thanks Peasantkia for PMing me. Nowadays I seldom hang around this sub thread.  Cheers Thanks a lot for taking the time to reply  Just only managed to see this. The fact that NBS doesn't record lectures is new to me hmmm.

Personally, I would rate your chances as quite low for accountancy because those applying is AAA/C at the 10th percentile, while you may still stand some chance for Business. What rank point would your grades translate to? Use your rank point and gauge from the appeal chance rater (in the first post of this thread), since AAA/D may translate into good or even better scores than the 10th percentile for NUS, AAB/C.  Not to forget, NUS is offering you additional 1.5 points to your first choice, so if your AAA/D rank point translates to a borderline, you would want to play your game well.

The essay is on some social topics such as prons and cons of meritocracy in education system and etc. While for NUS, they don't really focus on o level if your cgpa is above 3.95 (cause i got a friend who get into NUS biz even though he got C for eng and no amath) I hope my advice is able to help u. Wishing u all the best. Cheers Hi there, thanks for the information given. I have gotten a really poor grade for my O\u2019s English. This might be the reason i still have to attend an interview.  The email that i have received did not state that i have to write an essay or prepare for an essay, so does it mean that i do not have to prepare for an essay? Or is it a common sense for us to know that i have to wrote an essay?"},

You confirm get into Nus real estate. Applied nus real estate before with similar score as you. Got accepted by them, quite low demand per say for this course.  Heard from some, even you dont qualify for NUS RE cut off point, below their cut off point by 2-3 pts, the interview for this course is quite slack, just one question, Why you choose this course. Just give a general answer, you get in. They really need people for this course, very low demand. But even low demand, and they desperately need students, those in the 60s range trying to apply this course, seriously no hope.  For NTU maritime depends. But for smu, probably a bit hard , bcoz quite competitive, and highly demanded, 77.5 RP for SMU Biz based on last yr COP. If you are really offered NUS RE and NTU Maritime, which will you choose??

I'm apparently supposed to PM someone about this but this is a new account, so I am unable to do so  Any additional opinions on this course are also welcomed! Thanks a lot! Hi. Peasantkia PM me with regards to your questions on MS.  As a current student in MS, some of the challenges I saw are  1) most individuals do not know what which role suits them the best (eg Port Operations, Marine Insurance (underwriter), ship broker etc). There are multiple job prospect in the industry and it is all up to the individual to pursue depending on their personality and interests. Some may be more outspoken thus will go for brokering while some prefer operations which require strategic planning. 2) mandatory exchange to Norway (you can opt out if you really have a strong reason like financial issues) . Money is definitely an issue unless parents are rich. Most student who went for Norway will tell you its a beautiful country to be in, no doubt 3) competitive environment..but I think NBS is similar too. Most student during summer holiday chiong find internship and get various experience. Usually in ship management firm or ship brokering firm. Some student even full time study part time internship Other than these can't really think of any challenges.. Quite a chill course and most lectures are recorded unlike NBS. Saw your post on employment statistics, I personally think don't place to much emphasis on it la. If you are good in the course you studying, a lot employers are waiting to fight for you. If your result sucks then you are definitely at the lower end. Pay wise, MS quite standard. Always hear senior say low 3k. Anyway I also don't think starting pay is very important in the maritime industry. Most roles are commission based or includes allowance on top of basic which explains the low 3. Increment is frequent too. (all hear say one)  If you are from Polytechnic then maybe Math and statistics mod will be a huge barrier to you.  Thanks Peasantkia for PMing me. Nowadays I seldom hang around this sub thread.  Cheers"},

I got offered by SMU and NUS for Business Administration, still waiting on NTU hahaha. That's a great question which I will attempt to unpack, but firstly, credits to the many other contributors here that have been providing to their best ability, balanced points and listing pros/cons for various degree programs and universities. I recall seeing a comment from a SMU Prof along the lines of - \"If you flip a coin to choose between NUS/NTU/SMU Business Programs, you'll be fine!\". I believe that all things being equal, that very much holds true. However, if I may, I'll like to provide a strategy using the next one week for A Level graduates to consider when ranking choices (Regardless of Major / University): Crash* the classes for the courses you're interested in. Why? 1. Open House events are like CNY. Whole campuses spruce up and show you the best they have to offer. However, its not very reflective of day to day life and you don't have extensive exposure to how classes are conducted. 2. By crashing classes, you figure out a few things that contribute to decision making: - How to travel from home to the destination faculty - Will it be a hassle to travel everyday (or for a 1.5 hr class when my travel time is 1.5 hrs x2) - Does the style of teaching / first impression of profs & faculty / general mood of students suit you  *In terms of crashing classes, I use the term loosely. I generally advise approaching your seniors / friends in faculties and programmes that you're interested in and request for their help in asking Profs for permission to audit (another term for sitting in) sectional classes of 30-50 pax.  For lectures, this is not necessary as attendance is generally not taken and there are too many students to take note of. I also haven't come across Profs that would reject requests from prospective students to audit classes as they still have to teach regardless of your presence! (i.e. you're just taking up an empty space and listening)   For NUS Business, feel free to approach me if you wish to audit classes to help in decision making, I'll be more than happy to liaise with Profs to help prospective students.

Approximately half of the graduates don't get full-time jobs. I scrutinized the data and it was stated that full-time employment means more than 35 hours per week, and a non-temporary job. This means that half of those who graduate from NUS with a Bachelor in Sciences don't have permanent jobs, or don't work more than 35 hours a week, or are working part time. I have also taken into account of the fact that there are differences in cohort sizes and that may affect the percentages as well. For instance, Maritime Studies has a very small cohort in comparison to NUS Science, and seem to fit the demands of shipping companies better, and are hence mostly employed full-time upon graduation. Furthermore, they seem to receive a lot of govt support/funding for them to go on internships. Moreover, for the more general degrees such as NUS Science, the lack of full-time employment could be skewed towards one major in particular (since NUS Science can mean Life Sciences, Mathematics, Physics, etc.) But damn, doesn't change how dismal the prospects seem for some of these courses. Can someone comment and advise me on whether to take this data into consideration when applying to uni? I am interested in Biology and Economics in general but am rather hesitant about my choices after having seen the data. 10 dollars just apply If u have interest in a subject = Easier to study = Score 1st class = Get relevant internships easily as u have high GPA = Translate into good jobs into your desired field = End"},

If you are concerned with employment, you can actively seek for internships on your own initiative right from year 1 to boost your CV and gain experience that others don't. You can seek your university's attachment office and ask for help to vet your resume, attend workshops on acing interviews etc. Many graduates I know who got a job upon graduation are those who were offered employment during internship.

If you are going to pick a course besides Science just because of the GES statistics, I would say its almost stupid because the reality of the job market it as such.  If you are concerned with employment, you can actively seek for internships on your own initiative right from year 1 to boost your CV and gain experience that others don't.

Approximately half of the graduates don't get full-time jobs. I scrutinized the data and it was stated that full-time employment means more than 35 hours per week, and a non-temporary job. This means that half of those who graduate from NUS with a Bachelor in Sciences don't have permanent jobs, or don't work more than 35 hours a week, or are working part time. I have also taken into account of the fact that there are differences in cohort sizes and that may affect the percentages as well. For instance, Maritime Studies has a very small cohort in comparison to NUS Science, and seem to fit the demands of shipping companies better, and are hence mostly employed full-time upon graduation. Furthermore, they seem to receive a lot of govt support/funding for them to go on internships. Moreover, for the more general degrees such as NUS Science, the lack of full-time employment could be skewed towards one major in particular (since NUS Science can mean Life Sciences, Mathematics, Physics, etc.) But damn, doesn't change how dismal the prospects seem for some of these courses.

I'm pretty sure there's only anecdotal evidence available, but that's better than nothing.  I'm a science student that'd love to major in computer science.

Considering that I didn\u2019t get accepted during the early admission exercise and the sustained radio silence from both universities, I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019ll be shuffled back into science after all. Sigh! As a poly grad now in NTU, I only got one answer for all of you poly grads: If your GPA is far from their cut-off, do not pin any hopes on the universities. But if your GPA is nicely within their 10th percentile, then yes you definitely stand a good chance but then again, anything can happen. 3.94 seems okay, you just gotta wait and I hope you wrote well for your personal statement. They don't care what you studied in poly, its the GPA that they look at, and look at only.  So if you have GPA 3.3 and aiming for WKW, I would dare say your chances are very very very slim, even with your Dip w Merit, because there are people from other comms courses who may have a way higher GPA (that may meet the 10th percentile), yet did not get Dip w Merit. If you are trying by DA, which I highly recommend to anyone from poly, you really need to show that you have done comms-related stuff before, best if you have won some awards. CCA records are really nothing in their eyes, because every other JC kid also have good CCA records because it is simply part of their school life. To qualify under DA, you need to have something more than everyone else don't. Even then, there is no guarantee they will call you up for interview. I had a friend from NP comms who tried for two years, each year with additional things to her portfolio as she is working now, and did not get it."},

The bonus points, applicable to programmes not requiring a pre-entry interview, will be added to the student\u2019s University Admission Score. \" http://news.nus.edu.sg/highlights/nu...on-initiatives NUS applicants to get bonus points for 1st-choice courses Passion for a field of study will count for admission to the National University of Singapore (NUS) from this year. Those applying for a place at NUS will be given 1.25 bonus points for their first choice - equivalent to going from C to B or B to A in an A-level H1 subject. This applies only to courses where entry is based purely on converting a student's grades into points, and not to courses such as medicine and law where students are assessed on their aptitude and interests through interviews. NUS senior deputy president and provost Ho Teck Hua, who announced the move at a press conference on Monday, said NUS analysis of admission data showed the bonus point can make a difference. \"Let's say one student with 81 points applies for communications as his first choice, and another with 82 points applies to the same course as his second choice. With the 1.25 points, the student who lists the course as his first choice will get ahead of the person with 82 points,\" he said. On why NUS decided on the move, he said: \"If you have done well and are passionate about a career in business or computing, for example, then we want to say to you that we support your passion.\" \"We want to help you pursue your passion,\" he said, adding that students passionate about what they study tend to perform better. Professor Ho revealed that, currently, 65 per cent of students given a place in their first-choice course take up the offer, while only 45 per cent of those given their second-choice course do so. Noting NUS graduates' good job prospects, Prof Ho also announced that NUS will be increasing the number of double majors to increase career options for its graduates. \"The nature of work is changing very rapidly, and we need to prepare students for a lifetime of diverse careers,\" he said. He said NUS, which currently offers 94 double major and major-minor combinations, will add another 86 such programmes. \"Someone doing data science and entrepreneurship, for example, can go and work for a range of industries in data science, and also go and do a start-up.\" On top of the double majors, NUS also offers 71 double degrees, 33 joint degrees with partner universities and 24 concurrent degrees. Adding all this, currently 15 per cent of NUS students are trained in more than one discipline. Prof Ho said he hopes half of all NUS students will graduate with knowledge and skills in two different fields, so they will have more job offers to choose from. He also announced two new degree programmes for this year, one in pharmaceutical science and the other in veterinary science. Students taking up the 5 1/2-year concurrent veterinary degree programme will graduate with an NUS degree in life sciences and a Doctor of Veterinary Medicine from the University of Melbourne. NUS, which now offers 230 bond-free merit scholarships, will add 200 more scholarships for the new academic year. Ms Geraldine Tan, 19, welcomed the move by NUS and said it is important for young people to get into a field that excites them. She said: \"I really want to study business and maybe go on an overseas college stint as I want to start a social enterprise.

NEW DEGREES A new concurrent degree combines NUS' Bachelor of Science and the Doctor of Veterinary Medicine offered by the University of Melbourne.

The bonus points, applicable to programmes not requiring a pre-entry interview, will be added to the student\u2019s University Admission Score. \" http://news.nus.edu.sg/highlights/nu...on-initiatives NUS applicants to get bonus points for 1st-choice courses Passion for a field of study will count for admission to the National University of Singapore (NUS) from this year. Those applying for a place at NUS will be given 1.25 bonus points for their first choice - equivalent to going from C to B or B to A in an A-level H1 subject. This applies only to courses where entry is based purely on converting a student's grades into points, and not to courses such as medicine and law where students are assessed on their aptitude and interests through interviews. NUS senior deputy president and provost Ho Teck Hua, who announced the move at a press conference on Monday, said NUS analysis of admission data showed the bonus point can make a difference. \"Let's say one student with 81 points applies for communications as his first choice, and another with 82 points applies to the same course as his second choice. With the 1.25 points, the student who lists the course as his first choice will get ahead of the person with 82 points,\" he said. On why NUS decided on the move, he said: \"If you have done well and are passionate about a career in business or computing, for example, then we want to say to you that we support your passion.\" \"We want to help you pursue your passion,\" he said, adding that students passionate about what they study tend to perform better.

Can I ask if the universities take into consideration how we rank our choices? I heard that the Big 3 universities have a shared database.  My current cGPA is 3.61 (5th semester). I'm looking at NTU Sociology (3.58) and NUS FASS (3.74). (My O lvls L1R5 raw is 12, L1R4 is 9) Should I play it safe and put NTU Sociology as my 1st choice and just forget about NUS FASS? So that I have a higher chance of getting in if I rank it as my 1st choice? But at the same time I really want to try for NUS FASS... I'm hoping at least for an interview or an appeal or something so I want to rank it as 1st. But in that process I'm afraid I might have a much significantly lower chance of getting into NTU Sociology if I rank Sociology as 2nd  Especially since my cGPA isn't that much higher than the current 10th percentile... And I have a feeling it will rise this year since I know a lot of people looking at that course too...  Could someone please advise me? Thanks so much for your time. 1) The universities definitely do not share a common database. They will not know if you applied for other universities and how you ranked your choices at those universities. They assess independently of each other.  2) Unlike JAE, you do not submit your choices to MOE. You apply directly to the universities and you rank your choices among the said university. Open an account/ start your application with any of NUS/NTU to see what I mean.  3) So, therefore, you are free to apply for both NUS and NTU, though if you don't hit 3.7 by the end of your time in poly, it will be very very very tough for you to get shortlisted into NUS based on grades. Those who got called up with 3.7 were also accepted very late into the whole waiting game.  4) Why not consider SMU, since they have sociology as well?"},

Can I ask if the universities take into consideration how we rank our choices? I heard that the Big 3 universities have a shared database.  My current cGPA is 3.61 (5th semester). I'm looking at NTU Sociology (3.58) and NUS FASS (3.74). (My O lvls L1R5 raw is 12, L1R4 is 9) Should I play it safe and put NTU Sociology as my 1st choice and just forget about NUS FASS? So that I have a higher chance of getting in if I rank it as my 1st choice? But at the same time I really want to try for NUS FASS... I'm hoping at least for an interview or an appeal or something so I want to rank it as 1st. But in that process I'm afraid I might have a much significantly lower chance of getting into NTU Sociology if I rank Sociology as 2nd  Especially since my cGPA isn't that much higher than the current 10th percentile...

You are right. SMU seems to emphasize / promote applications for their scholarships than about admission.

{"name": "The Nature Boy", "message": "The key problem is just that - we don't know how the university admission score is computed. However, over the years, based on experience, inquiries with the Admission Office, information gathered from interviews etc, we can guesstimate how it works.  ==================================== University Admission Score - A guess at how its computed. Disclaimer : This is but a GUESS. Not Official. With that understanding, proceed. Official Information Available : Polytechnic Results - 80% 'O' Level Results - 20% The polytechnic results component seems straight forward enough : Take C.GPA / 4.00 * 80 , to convert to 80 marks. Examples. 3.90 => 78 / 80 3.85 => 77/ 80 3.75 => 75 / 80 3.50 => 70 / 80 Note how a majority of applicants would have GPA near or above 3.5 , resulting in a huge cluster of applicants scoring over 70 marks in the system. This would make more sense after considering the 'O' levels factor. ====================================== 'O' Level Component : We know that that only 5 Subjects, including English are required. It is unknown whether English has a heavier weightage, but we can assume no for now. Over interviews, I have gathered that the grading scale is linear. i.e. 2 A2s is equal to 1 A1 & 1 B3. With 5 subjects contributing to 20 marks, and the difference between each grade constant, we can guess the following scale. A1 4.00 A2 3.40 B3 2.60 B4 2.20 C5 1.60 C6 1.00 Alternatively : 20 - 0.6 (L1R4 - 5) An applicant with L1R4 of 7 points would therefore obtain 18.8 over 20 points, by this guesstimated system. If said student has a GPA of 3.85, his overall score would hence be 95.8. This score is entirely meaningless until you put it into perspective through some comparisons. (See below section) The Polytechnic grading system is different from that of the Os, so this is only a guess. We don't know if a C6 grade would award 1 point, but this should be fairly accurate if compared to the Polytechnic system. (The last pass grade has a GP of 1.0) ============================== Some further testing. L1R4 GPA Admission Score 5 4.00 100 7 3.85 95.8 14 3.97 94.0 ============================== At first glance, it would appear that the O lvls have a huge impact. There is another way of looking at this - to convert the O lvls into credit units and recompute the impact to the GPA. If 6 semesters of grades form 80%, then 20% would be 1.5 semester worth of Credit Units ! Imagine if you convert your O lvls grade into another semester. The impact would be pretty significant ! GPA 4.0 : 80 marks GPA 3.5 : 70 marks. Difference of 1 Grade : 10 marks. L1R4 5 points (All A1s) : 20 marks L1R4 10 points (Average A2) : 17 marks Difference of 1 Grade : 3 marks. Impact of Os on UAC should be about 25% of GPA, so this is fairly accurate. (Different scale though) Is this computation accurate?"},

Hi, I would say the chance of getting into NUS Comp Sci is low. If u have seen the subject pre requisite for the course, u must have a minimum of B3 for O levels A Maths. If u didn't meet the o level requirement, u need to have Diploma Plus in either Advanced Computing Maths or Advanced Engineering Maths. And if you also don't meet the diploma plus requirement, u will then be considered under the DA section for other achievements. Honestly, Comp Science is a very popular course over these years with a lot of demands(applicants). So your chances to NUS Comp Science is fairly low. I would suggest u to still apply, with the DA cos it highly increases the chances with the achievements u have. Good luck!"},

Once you graduate, you can only choose to do one career, either in the accounting industry or business industry. (the degrees dont rly complement each other) 2. People who usually take double degree is due to their indecisiveness of which career they are gng to pursue 3. A lot of seniors who are in double degree drops one of their degree towards the 2nd year of studies. I would say if you are sure you want to do accounting in future then take only accountancy. But if you are unsure of what career to pursue, then you can apply for double degree and only to drop after you realise that you dont have interest in that particular one. Anyway, good luck for your application!"},

Why are the stream of PBL experts from USA, Australia and the Scandinavian countries invited to Singapore since early this year ? A big guy from MOE stopped a recent argument by telling me that Stanford University (California, USA) uses PBL and that numerous medical schools do the same.  BTW, since secondary school moi and my friends have been googling for all information in order to answer / address our doubts or school work. In this day and age, it is the most efficient and effective method to acquire knowledge (apart from the library). In this regard, those RP guys googling away are just normal ?  Or are we weird ?  it is sad but I seldom open a book to check for information nowadays. My bad ? Hi, this is a thread about uni admissions, and I only wanted to point out a possible reason why RP may not be viewed as favourably. Whether it is true or not I don't know. Regarding PBL, everyone is going to have their own opinion on it. My stance has always been that participants must be matured and well-informed for PBL to be effective. PBL only works if you have a good understanding of fundamentals. Therefore, the most applicable would be higher-level university modules where the basics have already been mastered. Most polytechnic students are fresh out of O levels. Are they ready for PBL? I'm not sure man. Copying code from google for your intro to programming module is definitely not the best way to learn programming. Nonetheless, if PBL works for you, that is great. You have found a good way for yourself to learn. I'm not going to continue to engage in a discussion about how popular PBL is. There are universities that have implemented it, there are also many that have not.Om mani padme hum"},

I'm actually currently an ITE (going to be graduating soon) student that's looking on to which polytechnics I should advance on and then subsequently, I intend on going to Uni to do a degree. While I think the PBL-pedagogy is great I would prefer something old school perhaps like at SP, NYP or maybe even NP. I would be okay with joining any of their generalised Business Diplomas, but because my lecturers here at ITE have been telling me to go to RP supposedly (\"for increased chances to get top student and go to Uni\") hence that was where I was going with my original question on RP students who are mainly from R48, R52- what were their odds on advancing to University. Ultimately, I do not want to jeopardise my chances of getting to Uni if I go to RP, because I think even tho there are some benefits about PBL- the Big3 Unis still have some doubts & stigma about the learning style there at RP. At least that's what I heard when I talked to my lecturers.  Idk about you but I feel RP's Business or \"Management\" courses feels really lackluster in terms of what they cover unlike other Polys which offer dual specialisation options. Some of these which one can maybe even use in Uni? I would love to hear your thoughts. Thanks for the reply! I am from that prestigious poly with a motto in Malay \"Berkhidmat dengan Keahlian\". Lots of hype, smoke and mirror ... despite my academic excellence there. Still, I really believe that I am disadvantaged in life without PBL.  With regards to your concern, just concentrate on getting into a poly from ITE and let time dictate the outcome towards university. After all, it really \"is the singer not the song\". Meaning that if you excel in whatever you put your heart and mind to, the place you did it doesn't matter. Nothing can block your progress. You will then be positioned to do what you want to do. Not what you need to do. Like so many poor souls in this forum.  Be in the position where all university invites you to apply for priority (aka early) admission and lay out the 'red carpets' of talks, open house, individualised chats with professors, private group tours of labs, scholarship offers, etc. Be flagged by their admission scouts.

If you ask me, it has nothing to do with 'prestige' in the literal sense of the word. But there are factors that may make an NP/SP candidate more attractive to universities. 1) SP/NP are harder to get into compared to RP. No need to debate, just look at the entry scores for the same course.  2) Grading in RP more subjective than NP/SP. Due to its non-traditional assessment methods, a lot of grading is done somewhat arbitrarily by the facilitator. Get marks for asking questions in class...thanks... 3) PBL-approach is questionable. While sounding good in theory, PBL can only be applied in limited circumstances. Why? It only works if all participants have decent knowledge of the topic at hand. Putting random people together and asking them to solve a problem just doesn't cut it. Not at a level where participants only have 'O' Level knowledge. 4) SP/NP prepares its students better for a university education. Due to its traditional teaching methods, SP/NP students will be more prepared to enter university. They have good grounding in key concepts. University business courses do have some \"PBL-related\" assignments, but they are done in conjunction with traditional teaching. First year is definitely spent on fundamentals. Summary: I am not anti-RP per se. But the school has hyped itself to have a revolutionary teaching method. Does it work? Do RP grads perform better than SP/NP grads at work? Maybe, maybe not. From what I see at least, the RP grads who did well in uni, actually spent the most time getting their basics right. They knew it was a different ballgame from RP, and they were prepared to put in the effort to sit down and learn.

How are you going to climb down from your lofty position, should MOE decides to implement PBL in more or all polytechnics or IHLs in Singapore?  Why are the stream of PBL experts from USA, Australia and the Scandinavian countries invited to Singapore since early this year ? A big guy from MOE stopped a recent argument by telling me that Stanford University (California, USA) uses PBL and that numerous medical schools do the same.  BTW, since secondary school moi and my friends have been googling for all information in order to answer / address our doubts or school work. In this day and age, it is the most efficient and effective method to acquire knowledge (apart from the library). In this regard, those RP guys googling away are just normal ?  Or are we weird ?  it is sad but I seldom open a book to check for information nowadays. My bad ?Amituofo"},

Thank you.AmituofoYeah, it really isn't unfair to apply to multiple uni for the same course. It's more of a back-up and personal choice to apply to which uni you want to go . I chose NUS instead of NTU in the end, because of location and a more diverse spread of options for my major, despite the slight increase in competition. I think what isn't fair is for instance, you got into popular courses such as  medicine/law and dropped out due to personal reasons. This is unfair for potential students who tried so hard to enter into medica/law school, but failed to enter because you took their place and they could actually succeed. NUS/NTU opens up opportunities to transfer to these programmes if one is capable enough after the first year,so it helps to resolve the unfairness eventually. And I can give you a specific eg. as to why there is no downsides to applying for the Big 3 university. Let me illustrate this with a specific eg. with a friend's admission application 2 years back. (I applied in the same timeline too) My friend was not accepted into NTU med programme and was automatically offered scholarship with his second choice offer for bio sciences in NTU. During the scholarship talk, there was a girl who sounded out that she is opting out of the NTU scholarship, because she received an offer from NUS.(so basically, she got into NUS med,but failed to enter NTU) Hope this eg. explains that there aren't any downsides to applying for the different universities."},

By Mr. Davidktw.  23/03/2012. ================================================= Both NTU and NUS Computing is Good if you are a good student. I don't believe in any local university offer particularly better courses. I graduated from NUS SOC and is a Senior Consultant in a local IT firm on web applications and security deployments. I also full time *nix user from Linux to Mac to Hp UX to Solaris. I don't believe NUS Computer Engineering students are any better or worse, but I do agree their courses are designed to gear towards a different sector in computing such as embedding systems and silicon design from Intel, AMD etc and semiconductors fabrication. But nothing is stopping them from taking more SoC 3rd/$th year modules. Same goes for SoC, you can also opt for engineer modules like I took a year 1 module from mechanical engineer and it still benefit me today even though my work doesn't rely on it. I do Arduino programming and also Solidworks design for my friend. So don't be mistaken that anyone tell you that it is better in any local university. That's my opinion. How much you can benefit from the lectures and tutorial is up to your own initiative. If you are passionate about Computing, then you will be interested to learn more even without lecturers and tutors. The courses merely scratches the surface on the relevant discipline, your work is to do your own research and be passionate about what you want to achieve in the near future. Find something you are good in and improve on that aspect. Google is your good friend, relevant forums is your playground, and tertiary university is your incubator. With 3/4 years there, learn what is taught and venture on your own to go in-depth. Get yourself those internship available to get a taste of the industry standard. These are not taught in universities and only through training on the job. If you want to set a good impression in among your future boss, show that you can be independent and doesn't need spoon feeding. They won't assume you know everything, but they will assume you know what is taught in your university. Get to know some of your seniors and communicate with them as and when possible to have them give you glimpse into what they encounter outside before you do. It will give you good gauge on what to expect in the near future. Everyday the industry expectation is changing, today is Java, tomorrow is Ruby, Python and other emerging languages and technologies. Technology is going real fast, so if you are not street smart enough, you are no better than others around you, then what is your advantages to get employed when going for interviews. These are my 2 cents worth for your consideration. Absorb at your disposal. Cheers. "},

Do not miss out SMU, where your chances for a degree course is good. Do take a look at their IGP ... many of their 10th are below your cgpa. Keep moving, just don't stop and you'll be there somehow.

Moreoever by the time u get home, u will be too tired to study after dinner and shower.if u got the money, just pay to win.However, there are a lot of distractions in hall too esp ppl playing mahjong overnight etc Thanks for your advice. I am staying in the west and have done test trips to both NUS and NTU computer schools to gauge time / traffic condition etc. You are absolutely right. Even from Jurong area, it still takes about 40 minutes one way to get to the nearer NUS. If we factor in the morning rush hour crowds at the various interchanges, the trip could be stressful. So I will take your advice and try to get into one of those programmes they have over at UTown.  As for hostel fees, like all my other education funding, I will need to place myself at the mercy of scholarship / bursary administrators again to move forward.  I too have almost 24/7 mahjong distractions at home, but my cheap imitation Beats Bluetooth headphone and non-stop Mantovani help to block out most noise.  Thank you.

{"name": "Plow98", "message": "This post is over 5 years old, I have read it a couple of times.  By Mr. Davidktw.  23/03/2012. ================================================= Both NTU and NUS Computing is Good if you are a good student. I don't believe in any local university offer particularly better courses. I graduated from NUS SOC and is a Senior Consultant in a local IT firm on web applications and security deployments. I also full time *nix user from Linux to Mac to Hp UX to Solaris. I don't believe NUS Computer Engineering students are any better or worse, but I do agree their courses are designed to gear towards a different sector in computing such as embedding systems and silicon design from Intel, AMD etc and semiconductors fabrication. But nothing is stopping them from taking more SoC 3rd/$th year modules. Same goes for SoC, you can also opt for engineer modules like I took a year 1 module from mechanical engineer and it still benefit me today even though my work doesn't rely on it. I do Arduino programming and also Solidworks design for my friend. So don't be mistaken that anyone tell you that it is better in any local university. That's my opinion. How much you can benefit from the lectures and tutorial is up to your own initiative. If you are passionate about Computing, then you will be interested to learn more even without lecturers and tutors. The courses merely scratches the surface on the relevant discipline, your work is to do your own research and be passionate about what you want to achieve in the near future. Find something you are good in and improve on that aspect. Google is your good friend, relevant forums is your playground, and tertiary university is your incubator. With 3/4 years there, learn what is taught and venture on your own to go in-depth. Get yourself those internship available to get a taste of the industry standard. These are not taught in universities and only through training on the job. If you want to set a good impression in among your future boss, show that you can be independent and doesn't need spoon feeding. They won't assume you know everything, but they will assume you know what is taught in your university. Get to know some of your seniors and communicate with them as and when possible to have them give you glimpse into what they encounter outside before you do. It will give you good gauge on what to expect in the near future. Everyday the industry expectation is changing, today is Java, tomorrow is Ruby, Python and other emerging languages and technologies. Technology is going real fast, so if you are not street smart enough, you are no better than others around you, then what is your advantages to get employed when going for interviews. These are my 2 cents worth for your consideration. Absorb at your disposal. Cheers."}
