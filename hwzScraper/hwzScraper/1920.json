(Create an account if necessary)Strictly for NUS, NTU and SMU AY2019/20 only. For other unis please look up on their respective pages.Links will be updated from time to time.For chance rating: provide your (JC) grade profile & rank point - consider MT grade, rebase and take the higher of the two (original rank point or rebased rank point) or (Poly) poly course + 5th/6th sem CGPA + O Level L1R4, ranking of choices as well as citizenship status (Singaporean/ SPR/ International Student).15% of spaces for each university are reserved for DA. NUS and NTU still counts 20% O Level results for this round of admissions (the policy will be scrapped from 2020). For SMU, admission is based on 100% Poly GPA. All O Level subject requirements still apply. For NUS, first choice bonus admission points will apply to both A Level (1.25rp) and Poly (1pt) students for all non-interview courses, so please indicate if it is your first choice. [Poly to NUS SOC] Also note that if you are intending to apply to NUS Computing/ Computer Engineering and you do not have AMath/ Poly Math qualifications, your application to that course is considered a DA application no matter how high your GPA is.R/SGEXAMS UNI ADMISSION THREAD for referencehttps://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/com...ts_megathread/Previous year threads:2018-2019 (HWZ)2018-2019 (Reddit)2017-2018 Part 1 (HWZ)2017-2018 Part 2 (HWZ)2017-2018 (Reddit)2016-2017 Part 12016-2017 Part 22015-20162014-2015Useful Links:NUS IGP 2018/19NTU IGP 2018/19SMU IGP 2018/19Historical IGP Google SheetHistorical GES Google SheetMay the odds be ever in your favour"},

It is probably true that the odds of admissions are slim, but there are other ways to \u201cprove your abilities for math\u201d. Think outside the box (e.g might an exceptional SAT Math score help? Etc...) 2. IGP is indicative, and shows 90th and 10th percentile. What about the 1st to 9.99th percentile of students? There\u2019s no real way of knowing what the absolute cut-off in a given year is (after accounting for discretionary and mature admissions).  3. Relating to point 2, never say never. I was the last ranked undergrad in my cohort (academically) at admissions, but I still finished in 3.5 yrs with good hons. Always happy to help prospective students.

Yet again, if you have a good maths background (A in E and A maths or relevant poly modules), it could boost your chances.

For NTU, they would've sent an email for your enrolment decision, i.e. enrol in Aug 2020 or Special Term etc. For your case, if you intend to apply for a new course in 2020, their suggestion is to select 'enrol in Aug 2020'. This is to secure your spot in the uni, in case your new application is rejected.  If your new application was accepted, they will give you the option to choose between the two.

But if you need to a school admission letter first before applying, this year is gone case. You can try applying again next year. You can also try private uni but you must check if it's acceptable for student pass. With regards to your citizenship, yeah, you should have applied earlier if you wanted to stand a better chance. Even if you apply now, you still have to wait for a while, which could be years I think. So better start thinking of alternative options besides SG."},

Hi, Nursing has probably one of the lower GPA cut off so transferring to a more popular course of course is pretty low chance unless you are exceptional in your nursing first year and have some really good reasons to convince them... but to be fair you did not share your current grade here so... if it is not superb, then appealing is probably waste of time... Instead of appealing, you have to ask yourself what you want... a course you are interested in or a local uni degree.... for some, they did not even have a chance to enter NUS... of course doing something you do not like is also not something easy too...   Do take note that you have used up a year of your government subsidies for undergrad program.... for some, this may have some impact on their choices..."},

Think about it, you will have the upper hand compared to students who have no prior working experience. Once you graduate, employers will sought for graduates with more experience. You can accomplish many things during your gap year. Be it going overseas for a break, gaining work experience, building on your connections related to your field, be exposed to different jobs and giving yourself time to reconsider which field/job is MOST suited for you.

Hmm if you have any other academic certificates or testimonies that you would like to support your appeal statement, you may do so by emailing the admissions team but I think there is a limit also. If I'm not wrong, you must keep the file size within 5MB. Try not to also include documents that you have already provided in the check status menu. All the best for your appeal!

Answer:  If your application is successful, you may submit your appeal via online during the appeal period if you wish to change your offered programme. However you are advised to confirm your offered programme via online by the stipulated deadline as stated in the notification letter so that in the event that your appeal is unsuccessful, your originally offered course will still be valid.\" u can check ntu's faq website for more info!!  hope this helps!!

{"name": "Rockabye", "message": "FrostWurm wrote:  Erm...NUS hall life is actually more developed than NTU. NTU hall life is just joining interhall games. NUS biz (or even FASS) > NTU linguistics too Honestly, I think NUS hall is more packed than NTU's since it's required for you to take up 5/6 CCAs (as I hear from my jc classmates) to maintain your hall stay (unlike in NTU where you are guaranteed 2 years so it's your free choice to join 1 or 2 CCAs if you like or not unless you want to stay all 4 years in NTU). Also, NUS has 2 different forms of residence (halls and RCs).  NUS RCs, on the other hand, is pretty chill since you are not forced to take 5/6 CCAs to maintain your hall stay but you gotta take the mods in your RC. And damnn NUS RCs are really atas looking (I only have friends from Yale-NUS and Cinamon college so I'm referring to these 2 RCs). Like their recreational rooms with pool tables, football tables, X-box/Wii/Switch, mahjong tables, pianos/keyboard/guitar etc. and like it just look damn high-class in terms of the settings and interior design (esp. Yale-NUS obviously). It also has aircon rooms unlike NUS halls or so I heard about NUS halls.  Like it's really lavish for around the same fees as NUS halls (according to my friend it's 2k per sem also but I'm not sure if it's because she got subsidies or what not). The only bad thing about NUS halls and RCs is their fixed meal plan that you must pay for (that also include extras for friends/fam). I tried Cinamon College food and like it's not that bad but I can't imagine eating it every day. Of course, NTU halls are cheaper but I guess it's due to location and depends on which kind of halls you stay in (let me just talk about single rooms). Just a brief input of some halls: Like hall 1/2 probably have the biggest rooms (and maybe one of the cheapest rooms + they got attached toilets so you don't have to share with some terrible people + yays no peeping tom cases possible) and like they are close to Canteen 2 which has really good food, 7-eleven, ATMs, some hair-dresser, and my favourite giant express. Hall 6 is also close to can 2 but like because hall 6 isn't as big as hall 1/2, the no air-con thing in hall 6 really sucks (it's too hot for me).  Arguably, pioneer and crescent halls are like the most atas looking halls (even better than northhill halls imo and I stay at northhill). Like they have this forest-like serenity and also have a massive lake/pond in the middle of it. Also, their thai food at their canteen is also nice. Northhill halls aren't that bad besides its location (it's not close to northspine or southspine so you really gotta rely on the bus that seems to have a problem disappearing from the NTU bus app once it is supposedly going to reach northhill). In terms of food, it has a minimart, a terrible canteen and a prata restaurant that's actually not bad till it closes down this sem. Also, it has a terribly crowded gym. The best thing about northhill is that it got lounges almost every alternate. floor for each block and like free aircon + you can use it till whatever timing you want (even at 4 am the air con and lights work). Then there's the newest cluster of tamarind, meranti and saraca halls. They are not bad in terms of their canteens. And like it's new so you probably don't need to worry so much about creepy crawlies or it being too old/dirty since it's not even 1 year old. (I don't even see much bugs in my room at northhill so I expect less in these 3 halls) And like they got these amazing single rooms with not only aircon but an attached toilet like hall1/2 only way newer and more atas looking. If you can afford the price tho at 590$ per month (the most expensive hall rooms in NTU yet). They have rooms with the attached toilets without aircon too la but omg extravagence pls.  Halls 3/16 are located just beside NIE and hence really close to northspine as well; so they are close to NIE gym and NIE has one of the cheapest food that's really not bad. Halls 3/16 are pretty nicely renovated too so like it's really quite nice and the aircon can be *cough* really cheap too geddit. Just the food there isn't the best. Halls 12/13 are quite cool in terms of like how their room floors are like laminated wood?? Most hall rooms are just normal tiled floors I think or whatever it's called. Also, they are quite close to northspine/NIE too. Their aircon are crazily cheap too wink wink. Also, they are known to be a social hall so if you love drinking and what not, I guess this hall is perfect for you. Halls 4/5 have the biggest air-conditioned rooms and they are the closest to southspine; also, they are very difficult to get. That's all I know and hope it helps. Edit: I just saw the 'NUS biz (or even FASS) > NTU linguistics' too thing- I don't know what you mean by equating these but if in terms of cop, yea I guess NUS business is somewhat not the easiest to get in if you get 75 and below (above that, I think there's leeway or smth). However, not sure if NUS FASS > NTU linguistics. Last year, I heard of a PR student who got 80 rp and got interviewed for NTU linguistics. I guess NUS FASS and NTU linguistics are more or less equal in cop. However, really depends on the cohort also. A lot of people in HASS are pretty passionate about their courses just as FASS students are, maybe with the slight exception of some courses known to be taking in people who got rp that barely makes it (around 65-70). For those courses, well if a lot of people goes in with the mentality of 'no choice', I guess it's a self-fulfilling prophecy that many of them won't do well in uni and after."},

Honestly, go for what you can succeed in - even if you take accountancy and it's like a 'safe' path as in there will confirm be a demand for it, the pay depends on the kind of company (which depends on your capability).  My psych coursemate (hi you who recognised me from my typing style lmao) takes a double major in NTU and according to him if he doesn't get second upper honours minimally, he said there's no point to him taking it. I don't actually get it at first but he works as some higher level shyt at HR and they say being able to do well justify why taking certain degrees (double major/double degree/special courses or programme what not) give you an advantage compared to the people taking normal degrees (or \"less practical\" degrees). Also anecdotal evidence from my own mum- she takes accountancy but that's not her passion (not just that, she kinda sucks at it- she's more of a arts and social sciences person). And compared to my aunts who work as accountants, her salary was pretty shyt even for what I think for an accountant and hear about in the media (I mean this may not be relevant since it's quite long ago since she's retired pretty long). In a sense, she discouraged me from ever taking accountancy tho she don't mind if I take business."},

From what I understand is that NTU Psych major has a very in-depth research in psychology and that once I tread on this path, it might be quite hard for me to switch tracks if I'm found to be not really into the career options that are available for me to work on. As for business, I have some backgrounds on business and accounting knowledge but I'm not that sure if I would love to do business (i.e. marketing-related careers) in the future with a long-run effect.  If you are a marketing or psych grad/student or even those who has keen interest in these two courses, would you mind sharing your key ideas as to why would you choose either of the two courses and how I could better understand which path I should go.

Currently, I'm still debating if it's worth it to actually appeal for Biological Science anymore, as I found that Chem graduates actually have better employment rates (and higher median salaries compared to BS graduates - based off the statistics of 2018). So at this point should I even appeal anymore? Should I just accept this and move on? (I heard the chances of success are really low, and I don't really want to give myself false hope.) "},

NUS, NTU, SMU ETC: If you apply for a course in another uni you will still retain your old course spot in the old uni - you will need to email the admissions office of the old uni to rescind your course/scholarship offer, no repercussions involved as long as you haven't matriculated.  I would advice you to accept the backup offer from SMU first and try again next year for NUS.

{"name": "hengheng98", "message": "wassupcorn wrote:  If you\u2019re very very very interested in programming mods, then you should go ahead with NUS IS. As NUS IS needs to take a couple of CS mods which you\u2019ll expose to a couple more of programming languages for instance the C+, C#. Since you\u2019ll be taking CS mods, you\u2019ll be competing against students from Computer Science. It will be tougher (perhaps?) There\u2019ll also be bell curve in NUS IS. So it\u2019ll prolly be skewed, depending on the cohort.  For SMU IS, we are only exposed to Python (currently the most popular programming language) and Php (+ object oriented programming) And that\u2019s about it. Unless you\u2019re very interested in hard core programming, then that\u2019s where you\u2019ll choose to venture into the IT side when you choose your majors. However, as of year 1, these are the 2 primary programming languages you\u2019ll be exposed to. In SMU IS, we do not have bell curve (for IS mods only). It kinda encourages everyone to help up each other and learn from each other.  And ofc, that itself will not be sufficient. Be it whether you\u2019re in NUS / SMU, you still need to self learn a couple more programming languages outside of the curriculum to gain a better competitive advantage.  School is just a \u2018stepping platform\u2019 for you to start your IT journey.  Just to be more objective. NUS provides a solid foundation for you to start your IT journey. They are very technical in a sense that there\u2019s a lot of programming modules you\u2019ve to clear. However, for SMU IS, as they always say, we tend to fluff, package ourselves very well and kinda lack the hard-core technical skills.  So it really depends on your objective. Posted with corn HardwareZone Forums appThanks for your reply! Yup thats also another critical reason why I hesitate between NUS and SMU.

I really hope to get into NUS IS (I am interested in the modules offered) but no news till now so I am already prepared to face the worst scenario. I did receive an offer from SMU so I still got Plan B.  However, SMU school fees is higher than NUS by over 10k, which really makes me think whether should I take up SMU offer.  Personally, I like both SMU and NUS but school fees is really a factor that I must take into account of. Moreover, I do not have an extensive knowledge on how SMU IS curriculum. I wonder is it the same as NUS? or does it differ a lot?  So if NUS rejects me this year, I intend to reject SMU offer, and apply next year to NUS. The reason being university will no longer take into account of O Level result from Y2020 onwards. I was a PFP student and does not have an O Level result thus the long wait or possible rejection from NUS. So I would like to ask what are some of your thoughts on this?  1) Should I reject SMU this year and apply for NUS next year?  2) Do I stand a higher chance in getting accepted if I apply next year? (My CGPA is above 3.9)  Thank you everyone for reading this long post lol just wanna listen to some of your advices/opinions. Thanks! I am curious about something.

{"name": "wassupcorn", "message": "If you\u2019re very very very interested in programming mods, then you should go ahead with NUS IS. As NUS IS needs to take a couple of CS mods which you\u2019ll expose to a couple more of programming languages for instance the C+, C#. Since you\u2019ll be taking CS mods, you\u2019ll be competing against students from Computer Science. It will be tougher (perhaps?) There\u2019ll also be bell curve in NUS IS. So it\u2019ll prolly be skewed, depending on the cohort.  For SMU IS, we are only exposed to Python (currently the most popular programming language) and Php (+ object oriented programming) And that\u2019s about it. Unless you\u2019re very interested in hard core programming, then that\u2019s where you\u2019ll choose to venture into the IT side when you choose your majors. However, as of year 1, these are the 2 primary programming languages you\u2019ll be exposed to. In SMU IS, we do not have bell curve (for IS mods only). It kinda encourages everyone to help up each other and learn from each other.  And ofc, that itself will not be sufficient. Be it whether you\u2019re in NUS / SMU, you still need to self learn a couple more programming languages outside of the curriculum to gain a better competitive advantage.  School is just a \u2018stepping platform\u2019 for you to start your IT journey.  Just to be more objective. NUS provides a solid foundation for you to start your IT journey. They are very technical in a sense that there\u2019s a lot of programming modules you\u2019ve to clear. However, for SMU IS, as they always say, we tend to fluff, package ourselves very well and kinda lack the hard-core technical skills.  So it really depends on your objective. wallace189 wrote:  I am curious about something. Why did you even bother to apply for SMU when you SEEM to DISLIKE it? Like u mention that the course fees are high and you INTEND to reject it etc...\ud83d\ude02 Cos I won't bother SO MUCH if it is the course that I wanted and in the event that they have already ACCEPTED you.

I really hope to get into NUS IS (I am interested in the modules offered) but no news till now so I am already prepared to face the worst scenario. I did receive an offer from SMU so I still got Plan B.  However, SMU school fees is higher than NUS by over 10k, which really makes me think whether should I take up SMU offer.  Personally, I like both SMU and NUS but school fees is really a factor that I must take into account of. Moreover, I do not have an extensive knowledge on how SMU IS curriculum. I wonder is it the same as NUS? or does it differ a lot?  So if NUS rejects me this year, I intend to reject SMU offer, and apply next year to NUS. The reason being university will no longer take into account of O Level result from Y2020 onwards. I was a PFP student and does not have an O Level result thus the long wait or possible rejection from NUS. So I would like to ask what are some of your thoughts on this?  1) Should I reject SMU this year and apply for NUS next year?  2) Do I stand a higher chance in getting accepted if I apply next year? (My CGPA is above 3.9)  Thank you everyone for reading this long post lol just wanna listen to some of your advices/opinions. Thanks! Hi! I'm in similar situation. I graduated in 2017, coming from relevant Diploma with Merit CGPA 3.95.  I'm a PFP student as well but I do not meet the maths requirement. Thus, I've been trying DA as I have good CCA records (I won several awards in local IT competitions, represented SG in international competition before, worked as freelance developer as well as startup biz as well). I got invited for DA in 2017, but didn't manage to secure a spot. Applied last year & was rejected without interview and this year is my last year of applying as I managed to disrupt from National Service (I enlisted late). I currently accepted NTU Computer Science. I'm thinking whether to take a gap year to take O Level Maths to increase my chance as well as from Y2020 onwards, O level will not be taken into consideration. However, due to my family circumstances as well as discouragement from friends I most likely will be enrolling into NTU meanwhile just praying for some good news from NUS side. Haha. Are you a male or female?  If you are a male serving NS, You can accept SMU offer first and reapply next year.  I wish you all the best and hope you will get news from NUS soon!"},

And there's like no such things as closet muggers like in JC; people just actively encourage you to study and ask u to study with them (so no sneks).  Also, a lot of people in NTU psych are in WSC (volunteering club), doing RA (research assistant), and take elective modules in NIE (declare minors in early childhood/special needs/youth work/education blah which is related to psych) Honestly, I love uni so much more compared to JC because of my coursemates HAHA. I would say, in comparison to NBS, it feel more warmth (coz no sneks). Comparing with engineering, I guess it's hard to compare since there's so many diff engin faculty and there's sooooooo many people taking engineering so pretty sure there's a large variance and hence many types of ppl in engin (but using my biased limited sample size, I would think they look more ded compared to psych ppl - psych ppl seem to dress up more fun-ly) Oh ya, culture in NTU in general - study, supper, cca, hall? (+ ppl always queuing for welfare packs, freebies, and NBS shirts) Not sure what else to say about the culture in NTU Psych haha, you need to experience it yourself. !!!

{"name": "vangas", "message": "michael.scott wrote:  Vangas did you apply for NTU CS? Why NUS CS? Just curious.   1. NTU's CS curriculum is very rigid - you have to take certain specialization mods that aren't very useful for most CS grads like computer graphics, advanced software architecture, compiler techniques. You also need to take engineering math since you're under the engineering faculty.  Whereas if you look at NUS's CS curriculum, you'd notice that the compulsory CS mods are all general and to give you an introduction and foundation in CS. You can choose to study those advanced mods in specific focus areas.  Lastly, unlike in NTU where you can only start taking technical CS electives in your 3rd last semester, in NUS, you can start taking CS focus area mods as long as you completed the prerequisite mods.  This helps a lot as students who know what type of tech jobs they want can take relevant electives early to boost their chances of securing their internship after year 2.  2. NUS S/U system hands down beats NTU.  3. No need to stay in hall as travelling to NUS isn't as shag as NTU.  If you noticed, I didn't write anything about rankings because to be frank, judging unis based on rankings that take into account factors other than quality of education or professors is not a good idea."},

Anyone who wants to do psych can do so but they will be cleared away by Y1 anyway. By the time you are taking higher-level modules, the bell curve is frequently in the 70+ range anyway. That's true but I know of a few people who are taking advantage of this much lower RP to get into psych in NUS due to their inability to get into NUS science (obviously I don't get the logic- why is it \"no choice\" have to go into NUS psych as quoted from what my juniors say- a bit indignant since a lot of us psych majors actually went in with a passion or at least in NTU psych which is thus reflected in the higher 10th percentile RP of 77 which was the same as NUS science when I last applied- it shows that a lot of those who entered ntu psych could have gone for numerous other courses but chose ntu psych)  tho, it seemed like rp for NUS science 10th percentile have risen this yr. I use the point of rp to just illustrate the point about choice - that when ntu psych first started which isn't super duper long ago, some of those who entered ntu psych was because they couldn't get into nus fass- but now it's the reverse. Choice is related to passion anyways coz not everyone get to choose where they want to go and hence chase their passion, and this also is to support my point that you replied to that there is really motivating environment spurred by passion. This point is not to put down FASS (if you feel offended) but to explain why some people may think NTU psych isn't that good compared to NUS psych- in which one of the reasons is due to some of those in NTU psych couldn't get into NUS FASS in the past aka rejects (NTU psych was BBB/C for the 2012 intake while NUS FASS was BBB/B for the 2012 intake; currently, NTU psych is AAC/C for the 2018 intake and NUS FASS is BBC/B for the 2018 intake)"},

With placement test no longer an option for applicants from 2018 onwards, there's no more 2nd chances to do psych if you don't get a B- I must emphasize it's B- hor, not B.

Being an NSF, i had 3 windows to apply for my courses. Some info about me: I had a RP of 80 from my A levels, but my H2 subjects were all Bs. I took a subj combi of PCME, where econs was my H1. Basically in the first window, i applied for chem eng in NUS and i got offered for that course so i quickly accepted it, being the course i wanted at that time. The second window, i didnt apply for a new uni nor change my course The third window, which is this year , i tried to apply for new courses in NUS, which was Food Science and Pharmaceutical Science which i knew it was difficult to enrol in but i wanted to try to see my luck as those 2 were what i had the most interest in, and i thought that even if i didn't make it in, i still had chem eng to fall back on. This was where i made 2 fatal mistakes, potentially ending my dream The first mistake i made was that i didn't read the NUS website properly whereby they stated that if you are being offered for a new course, your old course will automatically be removed and if you reject your new course, you will be left with no course to enrol in for the upcoming semester. This basically means that i was forced to accept my new course Talking about my new course, this was where my 2nd devastating mistake came in. After putting pharm sci and food sci as my first and second choice respectively, as i didn't know( my first mistake) about the NUS website, i decided to fill up the rest of the choices. I had business for third, computer sci for forth and FASS for fifth. And guess what, i got offered into FASS... Being a sci student since pri sch all the way to JC, i can say that my interests lie in Science related subjects and i have totally no experience or knowledge in the field of ARTS. I know that if i am forced to take FASS this year, i will struggle for the 4 years that i study in uni(because i really dont have a major i want to take in FASS) and eventually my life will be fked up. I can also choose to delay 1 year and reapply again next year, and this time i will apply for chem eng but im scared of wasting my time if i dont get my desired choice and also im being left behind by my peers. I called the NUS number earlier but they told me all i can do is to appeal during the appeal period. But they told me it's subjected to supply and demand and i do know engineering has waned over the past few years compared to the rising demand of the tech savy courses which means the cohort size for engineering will be smaller as a result. I checked the IGP for 2017 and 2019, i compared it and the cohort size is indeed smaller. I am really afraid now as i do not want FASS( the only reason why i put that as fifth was because i just considered economics) but i know i wont be able to study and be an economist in the future. It is just not my cup of tea. I really regret not reading the website properly and knowing beforehand the details. Any kind souls can help me with this situation? Please do not flame because i want as many solutions as i can have to go back to chem eng. Time to prepare your appeal essay to be submitted.  Posted from PCWX using ONEPLUS A6000"},

Content: NTU and SMU accounting modules are similar according to my NTU Accountancy friends.  More or less the same, but the depth may vary according to the electives taken. 2. Seminar style: SMU has it for all classes. NTU has it, but I'm not sure.3. Exemptions: - For professional qualifications, for SMU, you can get 12 out of 15 exemptions (provided you pass the requisite papers) for ICAEW. - For NTU, I'm not sure, but I've a friend who took advanced tax and (i heard) is exempted from CA Singapore's Tax paper. (Need to confirm.)Differences1. Cost SMU = $11k per annum for 4 years = $44k NTU = $8k per annum for 3 years = $24k Yup the cost difference is quite large (assuming we don't factor in hostel fees).2. Exemptions - This is more applicable if you're a poly student. If your poly's CGPA is >= 3.8, you can get a maximum of 10+ exemptions from SMU. This means you can graduate in 3 years from SMU even without overloading modules. 3. Location - SMU is more accessible, unless you stay in the west then NTU is more accessible.4. Ability to SU modules! - SMU: Has the option to SU two elective modules only when you file for graduation.  - NTU: Can SU some electives according to their website. 5. Graduate starting pay Already mentioned by SiaoLengKeng earlier in this thread, the starting pay for big 4 for both NTU and SMU graduates are similar. $3,000+ for audit.6. Other misc requirements - SMU has a compulsory 80 hours community service requirement + 1x overseas trip requirement. Overall, if we compare just by cost alone, NTU would be better because it is more cost efficient, but if we consider other factors, then there's no uni that's \"better\".

Does not matter if you are from SMU or NTU because you have equal exemptations. Some companies also give you the option of completing ICAEW. But I guess this mainly applies to to SMU kids who have exemptions.  If you intend to practice accounting in Singapore, it is good to have the CA SG license. If you already decided that you want to be an accountant(audit/tax), graduating early to have an extra year of work experience is advantageous. So, a plus point for NTU in this regards.  NUS (accounting) gives you a chance to double-specialise in other fields (like finance/business analytics/minor from other faculty) because you have 6-8 free modules in your curriculum. Accounting job may not be your cup of tea due to the long working hours, so many of my friends eventually go to other fields of business. I am not sure if this flexible curriculum applies to SMU (accountancy), which is also a 4 years direct honors programme. I am from nus accounting Thank you for the insight, Fearah! "},

NTU should be recognized since it's higher than a lot of other UK universities as well. You can look up the UK universities yourself and see if they specify anything, or contact them. But I'm 99% sure it's recognized. Ik of ntu grads who went overseas for Masters/Phds!"},

If I was under the NTU system, I would have S/Ued a sociology module that I got an A for  As for \"doing psych immediately\", I don't see the rush. The two intro modules helps build up a decent foundation and there are general education modules and basket modules to clear anyway. Not to mention, the NUS system allows freedom to explore different kinds of combination.  As for whether NUS or NTU is better, there's not much difference. NUS psych don't care if NTU psych is better or not and I doubt NTU psych cares if NUS is better or not.  I know some friends who rush to clear their psych mods but for the most part, many prefer to spread it out over semesters to not overload.

What are the pros and cons for both schools? I'm not sure about NTU, but I can share some from my perspective as an SMU Accountancy student.Similarities1. Content: NTU and SMU accounting modules are similar according to my NTU Accountancy friends.  More or less the same, but the depth may vary according to the electives taken. 2. Seminar style: SMU has it for all classes. NTU has it, but I'm not sure.3. Exemptions: - For professional qualifications, for SMU, you can get 12 out of 15 exemptions (provided you pass the requisite papers) for ICAEW. - For NTU, I'm not sure, but I've a friend who took advanced tax and (i heard) is exempted from CA Singapore's Tax paper. (Need to confirm.)Differences1. Cost SMU = $11k per annum for 4 years = $44k NTU = $8k per annum for 3 years = $24k Yup the cost difference is quite large (assuming we don't factor in hostel fees).2. Exemptions - This is more applicable if you're a poly student. If your poly's CGPA is >= 3.8, you can get a maximum of 10+ exemptions from SMU. This means you can graduate in 3 years from SMU even without overloading modules. 3. Location - SMU is more accessible, unless you stay in the west then NTU is more accessible.4. Ability to SU modules! - SMU: Has the option to SU two elective modules only when you file for graduation.  - NTU: Can SU some electives according to their website. 5. Graduate starting pay Already mentioned by SiaoLengKeng earlier in this thread, the starting pay for big 4 for both NTU and SMU graduates are similar. $3,000+ for audit.6. Other misc requirements - SMU has a compulsory 80 hours community service requirement + 1x overseas trip requirement. Overall, if we compare just by cost alone, NTU would be better because it is more cost efficient, but if we consider other factors, then there's no uni that's \"better\". It'll depend on your personal preference!"},
{"name": "Anti0xidant", "message": "Hi I am a from the 2016 batch who took the A levels I enlisted in NS in Jan 2017 and ORDed in NOV 2018. Being an NSF, i had 3 windows to apply for my courses. Some info about me: I had a RP of 80 from my A levels, but my H2 subjects were all Bs. I took a subj combi of PCME, where econs was my H1.  Basically in the first window, i applied for chem eng in NUS and i got offered for that course so i quickly accepted it, being the course i wanted at that time. The second window, i didnt apply for a new uni nor change my course The third window, which is this year , i tried to apply for new courses in NUS, which was Food Science and Pharmaceutical Science which i knew it was difficult to enrol in but i wanted to try to see my luck as those 2 were what i had the most interest in, and i thought that even if i didn't make it in, i still had chem eng to fall back on. This was where i made 2 fatal mistakes, potentially ending my dream The first mistake i made was that i didn't read the NUS website properly whereby they stated that if you are being offered for a new course, your old course will automatically be removed and if you reject your new course, you will be left with no course to enrol in for the upcoming semester. This basically means that i was forced to accept my new course  Talking about my new course, this was where my 2nd devastating mistake came in. After putting pharm sci and food sci as my first and second choice respectively, as i didn't know( my first mistake) about the NUS website, i decided to fill up the rest of the choices. I had business for third, computer sci for forth and FASS for fifth. And guess what, i got offered into FASS... Being a sci student since pri sch all the way to JC, i can say that my interests lie in Science related subjects and i have totally no experience or knowledge in the field of ARTS. I know that if i am forced to take FASS this year, i will struggle for the 4 years that i study in uni(because i really dont have a major i want to take in FASS) and eventually my life will be fked up. I can also choose to delay 1 year and reapply again next year, and this time i  will apply for chem eng but im scared of wasting my time if i dont get my desired choice and also im being left behind by my peers. I called the NUS number earlier but they told me all i can do is to appeal during the appeal period. But they told me it's subjected to supply and demand and i do know engineering has waned over the past few years compared to the rising demand of the tech savy courses which means the cohort size for engineering will be smaller as a result. I checked the IGP for 2017 and 2019, i compared it and the cohort size is indeed smaller. I am really afraid now as i do not want FASS( the only reason why i put that as fifth was because i just considered economics) but i know i wont be able to study and be an economist in the future. It is just not my cup of tea. I really regret not reading the website properly and knowing beforehand the details. Any kind souls can help me with this situation? Please do not flame because i want as many solutions as i can have to go back to chem eng."},

(Need to confirm.) If you have set your mind to do audit/tax in big 4 or mid tiers, the companies usually would sponsor you to complete SQP/CA(SG) (advanced level). Does not matter if you are from SMU or NTU because you have equal exemptations. Some companies also give you the option of completing ICAEW. But I guess this mainly applies to to SMU kids who have exemptions.  If you intend to practice accounting in Singapore, it is good to have the CA SG license. If you already decided that you want to be an accountant(audit/tax), graduating early to have an extra year of work experience is advantageous. So, a plus point for NTU in this regards.  NUS (accounting) gives you a chance to double-specialise in other fields (like finance/business analytics/minor from other faculty) because you have 6-8 free modules in your curriculum. Accounting job may not be your cup of tea due to the long working hours, so many of my friends eventually go to other fields of business. I am not sure if this flexible curriculum applies to SMU (accountancy), which is also a 4 years direct honors programme. I am from nus accounting"},

Have a good day! Think you stand a pretty fair chance dude. Speaking from experience, I'm graduating with your 4th sem gpa but I managed to get an offer from Yale-NUS and my interview for SMU is tomorrow.  For both Uni, I must say I did put it in a lot of effort for my application ie. by writing a good college essay(YNC)/cca accomplishments (SMU). So if you really put in the effort I think it will bear good results.  Just try your luck!! And I'm not even in a business course so it was a surprise when they did call me for biz interview"},

With regards to job prospects, I'll say that there are those who graduate with a physics degree but do something completely unrelated after that (eg: finance) There are those who enter slightly related fields (eg:IT/engineering/teaching) And there are those who enter niche areas (eg: medical physicist/nanotech+semiconductor research) The job prospects are actually decent. Perhaps it is the lack of clear career paths that makes people assume that physics graduates can't find jobs. (unlike something concrete like engineering degree -> engineering job)  I chose physics because I like it, I enjoy learning more about how the universe works (typical answer but yeah)"},

Congrats on pulling up your GPA but tbh, I think schools will only look at your overall GPA. They won't even care if you scored 4.0 in your 5th sem. Considering last year's NTU IGP for Physics at 10th percentile is 3.52, you are way off and it'll be really hard. Won't say it's impossible because only the school's admission team will have all the statistics/data/info on how they accept students.  So unless you applied through DA with your achievements/CCAs, interview is a possibility, otherwise I would say it's tough. Good luck and keep working hard. "},

Do read up a little on what accountancy entails, skim through the modules and think of some questions to ask your interviewers. 2. Draft a simple response for the \"tell me about yourself question\". Use this opportunity to share more important facts about yourself, perhaps 3 points, such as: a. Past: What have you done? (JC/Poly) b. Present: What're you currently doing? Part-Time job? c. Future: Plans? Thoughts about your degree choice. (Why accountancy 1st? If not, why the 1st choice for your application?)

It mainly depends on your cgpa/cap and relevant experience as research assistant/independent research (for those with really really good cgpa). Since masters in clinical psychology is what most first yr psych majors initially set out to pursue (coz for $$$/prestige besides being in research/PhD), the competition is very stiff (especially given its limited vacancies in sg) and you gotta be the creme of the crop or else you need to go overseas to complete it.  Tbh, in NTU/NUS, psychology is not as heavily based on groupwork as SMU's, so if you are not as good as academics as your peers (can roughly gauge by ur rp), you can kind of forget trying to vye for the limited spots.  Obviously, everyone would say your past academic performance (in JC) won't always predict what you get in uni but like from my very small and hence biased  sample size of my cohort intake of first year students, those with rp below 10th percentile (those who get around 76), they really kind of struggle while those from the top 5 jcs (HCI, VJC etc) and with  over 85 rp (which is quite a lot) and getting FCH. (Since NTU psych and probably NUS psych is more individual and test based unlike SMU's) If you are just trying to enter psych coz you think its interesting and only able to see its traditional path of clinical psychology (and not understanding what else is there to psychology), i think going nus fass is good so you can declare majors in other arts and social science should you realize you dont get at least a certain cap (e.g. 4.5/5.0) by the end of year 2 semester 1."},

Since masters in clinical psychology is what most first yr psych majors initially set out to pursue (coz for $$$/prestige besides being in research/PhD), the competition is very stiff (especially given its limited vacancies in sg) and you gotta be the creme of the crop or else you need to go overseas to complete it.  Tbh, in NTU/NUS, psychology is not as heavily based on groupwork as SMU's, so if you are not as good as academics as your peers (can roughly gauge by ur rp), you can kind of forget trying to vye for the limited spots.  Obviously, everyone would say your past academic performance (in JC) won't always predict what you get in uni but like from my very small and hence biased  sample size of my cohort intake of first year students, those with rp below 10th percentile (those who get around 76), they really kind of struggle while those from the top 5 jcs (HCI, VJC etc) and with  over 85 rp (which is quite a lot) and getting FCH. (Since NTU psych and probably NUS psych is more individual and test based unlike SMU's) If you are just trying to enter psych coz you think its interesting and only able to see its traditional path of clinical psychology (and not understanding what else is there to psychology), i think going nus fass is good so you can declare majors in other arts and social science should you realize you dont get at least a certain cap (e.g. 4.5/5.0) by the end of year 2 semester 1.

For your interview, you'll have a faculty and a senior student/alumnus as your interviewers.  The interview is to assess, roughly, whether you're a good fit for the school. Tips 1. Do read up a little on what accountancy entails, skim through the modules and think of some questions to ask your interviewers. 2. Draft a simple response for the \"tell me about yourself question\". Use this opportunity to share more important facts about yourself, perhaps 3 points, such as: a. Past: What have you done? (JC/Poly) b. Present: What're you currently doing? Part-Time job? c. Future: Plans? Thoughts about your degree choice. (Why accountancy 1st? If not, why the 1st choice for your application?) From here, the interviewers may ask questions about what you've said, but this should be quite chill.  3. Don't say you choose accountancy because your parents told you to and other killer answers and you should be fine!"},

Please advice thank you so much!! if you use your 5th sem results to apply in 2020 intake and received a rejection letter from the uni, you have no choice but to look for other alternatives or re-apply with 2021 intake (which you will apply with 6th sem results since you have graduated from poly by then) But, considering how NTU civil engineering igp is >3.49 (unless the IGP God decides to **** on you and increase for next year's intake), likelihood you should have a high chance esp when you are from a related course. TL;DR it is either you apply in 2020 with 5 sem or you apply in 2021 with 6 sem results when you graduate  and don't get complacent and just focus on maintaining and improving your gpa in the meantime to get higher chances "},

To add on, all the best in your university journey as a year 1 student studying psych in NTU! Really enjoyed the process of exchanging views! Oh, and i forget to add, according to one of my TA (those currently on their path to PhD), to get into clinical and criminal psychology (the two most competitive branch for post-grad), you would first apply for some assistant role under some certified psychologist in that field before you can undertake master's. In both cases, it requires you to be able to analyze and read research papers and calculate/understand the statistical results for the papers (this will be under their technical interviews). Therefore, to successfully pursue a path in clinical or criminal psychology, it is very important to be able to be critical in reading research papers and also being good in your statistics HAHA (i would think both the NUS and NTU psychology do emphasize on this) I would urge you to take on research assistant roles when you enter university to allow you to be more familiar with the roles. Additionally, to kind of understand better which uni you would be more inclined to, FASS openhouse (the second openhouse) would occur somewhere in may if I don't remember wrongly! You can then get a better idea of how psychology is like (you can ask the psych seniors there). Btw I didn't choose FASS psychology not because of any supposed flaws it has in comparison to the other universities, but rather I just feel the FASS open house doesnt send off the right feels for me as NTU's (this is very superficial lel but I feel having the right feels is very important to me)"},

In ntu, besides taking the psych core mods, many NTU psych majors also take up NIE mods as their minors (such as in counselling, special needs, early childhood, youth pathopsychology, educational psychology and the list goes on HAHA) In nus, i believe there are social work modules that you can take either as a second major, minor or free electives (which seems to suit your passion of helping others!) I feel that SMU is more geared towards business and may not necessarily suits your future career aspirations (not because it's not as good but it doesn't seem in line with your goals) Also, maybe you can take into consideration the environment you work best in and maybe travelling time (because tbh, there shouldn't be that much diff between the 3 uni in terms of prestige- psychology in the 3 uni aren't ranked very highly in the world actually- most of my coursemates would love to enrol in overseas uni if they got the $$$)  also, I am not in the position to speak for poly students since Im from the JC route (so im not very sure ^^\"; all I know is that NUS FASS cop is BBC/B and NTU psych cop is AAC/C to apply; I didnt apply to SMU psych- however, i heard it's based more on interviews rather than just your rp like for NTU/NUS? Im not very sure) Actually, you may also consider that NTU psych is a direct honours track, and direct honours is basically what it is; however, if you are not planning to take masters (in which having honours makes it easier to), you should save your money and just go NUS FASS (3 years if you cant/dont want to get honours) Hope this helps!

Food for thought... I'm sorry. I am just really puzzled. Thanks a lot for replying. In my opinion, distinction only matter if you are comparing two GPA 4 students. The first GPA 4 student doesnt have any distinction for any modules while the second GPA 4 student has more distinctions then clearly the latter will be better.  Don't be disheartened man. I think for 3.9x student, you should focus on building your resume for scholarship. Admission into Uni shouldn't be a problem so long as you meet their O Level grade requirements for certain courses."},

I grew fondly for social science (i.e. psychology) even though I am a poly student who studies accountancy and have a mixture of accounting and business knowledge. 2. I feel that I want to study with a deeper meaning and that it would benefit both society and myself. (I love to make people smile and be happy, thinking on the positive side) 3. I would not only just basically want to study on psychology, I want to expand my knowledge such as taking extra courses that would broaden my career prospects. The above facts are there to briefly describe what are my thoughts now because I do not want to regret choosing the wrong course in the end but still I'm planning to enter a local uni as of now. I would really appreciate any feedbacks or suggestions from any point of view.  Thanks guys!    Hi, im currently a y1 psych student in NTU! I believe NTU/NUS would be a better choice given your goals and aims in life! In ntu, besides taking the psych core mods, many NTU psych majors also take up NIE mods as their minors (such as in counselling, special needs, early childhood, youth pathopsychology, educational psychology and the list goes on HAHA) In nus, i believe there are social work modules that you can take either as a second major, minor or free electives (which seems to suit your passion of helping others!) I feel that SMU is more geared towards business and may not necessarily suits your future career aspirations (not because it's not as good but it doesn't seem in line with your goals) Also, maybe you can take into consideration the environment you work best in and maybe travelling time (because tbh, there shouldn't be that much diff between the 3 uni in terms of prestige- psychology in the 3 uni aren't ranked very highly in the world actually- most of my coursemates would love to enrol in overseas uni if they got the $$$)  also, I am not in the position to speak for poly students since Im from the JC route (so im not very sure ^^\"; all I know is that NUS FASS cop is BBC/B and NTU psych cop is AAC/C to apply; I didnt apply to SMU psych- however, i heard it's based more on interviews rather than just your rp like for NTU/NUS? Im not very sure) Actually, you may also consider that NTU psych is a direct honours track, and direct honours is basically what it is; however, if you are not planning to take masters (in which having honours makes it easier to), you should save your money and just go NUS FASS (3 years if you cant/dont want to get honours) Hope this helps!

I withdrawn from NTU from a 4 year programme after 1 sem in 2018, receiving TG of 8 sems. Which leaves me 7 more sems of TG. This year I enrolled in a direct year 2 course, which has a total of 6 sems. However, I\u2019m planning to extend by 1/2 sems of study as I didn\u2019t want to over stress myself.  For NTU, if you delay by 1 semester, tuition fees will be capped at 120% of the subsidised fee, 2nd semester at 150% of the subsidised fee and so on. And yup, since you alr used up 2 sems of TG, you are only left with 6 sems. So your total tuition fees would work out to be around 24k + 4.92k (first sem) + 6.15k (second sem) Not sure about other unis though, but you might want to check with the unis whether they have caps on subsidised fees. Goodluck!"},

Not too sure about NTU courses, but i do know NUS FASS offers you a wide array of courses to take outside of psychology. Besides, you can choose to specialise after year 1. You may want to give yourself that 1 year to explore the introductory courses from different departments and speak to seniors to get a feel of how they're doing. With regards to your point 2, have you looked into NUS Social Work? I have friends who are graduates from that field and they have plenty of opportunities to make people smile and be happy  although i must say that it can be quite demanding because your clients can be quite difficult to manage.

How would the career option differ if I chose to take a Business course,  specializing in finance, as opposed to taking an Accountancy course? Hi there! I could only give you general insights (not only applied in uni) on how both courses differentiate against each other. Basically for accountancy, it is a more specific field where students get to learn how to craft out financial statements, do budgets and analyze certain accounting figures to assist management in decision-making through a course in management accounting. You would receive knowledge on auditing and taxation as well. Hence, you would eventually gain career prospects to the Big 4 firms and self-source accounting firms (SMEs) etc. However, for finance in business, it is more of learning about stocks exchange, investments, financial tools to hedging etc. It is more about receiving knowledge on both the banking and broker sides. I can't address too much about this but I could only say that finance would lead to to possible career options such as investment banker and stock broker etc. At the end of the day, finance and accountancy both have their own specific skills which would lead to a myriad of job opportunities as companies would want to hire graduates who attain some knowledge on the financing and accounting sectors. Of course, that being said, you will still have to learn some basic business knowledge on both sides since its a core element that is imparted to students. Hope this would help you have a better insight on both differences as I could only give you general comments on this. "},

You can just fill up if u have the relevant achievements. So, da is also in the same application as the normal one. For NTU, you have to go another link to submit the da too. So you have to submit the normal + da. Basically, can just go ahead and try DA  Ultimately, they still look at your results."},

Will need some exceptional \"qualities\", \"CCA\", \"volunteering\" and of course a good interview with NUS to get him admitted for the program.

As you like the course curriculum of NUS Biz Analytics, the SUTD ISTD Biz Analytics course is directly in line with your interest. Computing is involved as there are machine learning and data analytics core module called \u201cThe Analytics Edge\u201d that you can take from the ESD pillar as well if you select the SUTD ISTD Biz Analytics course.

Singaporean Diploma in aeronautical engineering (singapore poly)  Diploma plus in math and sci Grad in 2014 GPA 3.74 Worked for the past 5 yrs as an aircraft technician.  L1r4 11 L1r5 14 Olvl a/e math and physics all A Chance is 50-50. Don't worry, aeronautical engineering can take CEG, just that no module exemptions so you have to do 4 years. Also depends if you're applying as a mature candidate or not. If you're not applying as a mature candidate, since the IGP for CEG is 3.74, you're very borderline. If you're applying as a mature candidate, NUS will disregard your diploma results and use SAT results. So you'd have to take SAT if you want to enter as a mature candidate, but it also depends on how well you can do for SAT."}
