Due to the recent influx in posts for next year's application... for organisation's sake, do ask your questions here! (Create an account if necessary),
,
,Strictly for NUS, NTU and SMU AY2019/20 only. For other unis please look up on their respective pages.,
,
,Links will be updated from time to time.,
,
,For chance rating:, provide your (JC) grade profile & rank point - consider MT grade, rebase and take the higher of the two (original rank point or rebased rank point) or (Poly) poly course + 5th/6th sem CGPA + O Level L1R4, ranking of choices as well as citizenship status (Singaporean/ SPR/ International Student).,
,
,15% of spaces for each university are reserved for DA. NUS and NTU still counts 20% O Level results for this round of admissions (the policy will be scrapped from 2020). For SMU, admission is based on 100% Poly GPA. All O Level subject requirements still apply. For NUS, ,first choice bonus admission points, will apply to both A Level (1.25rp) and Poly (1pt) students for all non-interview courses, so please indicate if it is your first choice. ,[Poly to NUS SOC] Also note that if you are intending to apply to NUS Computing/ Computer Engineering and you do not have AMath/ Poly Math qualifications, your application to that course is considered a DA application no matter how high your GPA is.,

	,
,Let me first caveat that I did not grad from NUS InfoSys / SOC.,
,
1. It is probably true that the odds of admissions are slim, but there are other ways to “prove your abilities for math”. Think outside the box (e.g might an exceptional SAT Math score help? Etc...),
,
2. IGP is indicative, and shows 90th and 10th percentile. What about the 1st to 9.99th percentile of students? There’s no real way of knowing what the absolute cut-off in a given year is (after accounting for discretionary and mature admissions). ,
,
3. Relating to point 2, never say never. I was the last ranked undergrad in my cohort (academically) at admissions, but I still finished in 3.5 yrs with good hons.,
,
,
,
Always happy to help prospective students. Do reach out if you would like a more detailed consult, cheers "

	,
,Its very unlikely that the 10th percentile cut off will drop the coming year. Yet again, if you have a good maths background (A in E and A maths or relevant poly modules), it could boost your chances. ,
,
In NUS, you can always take up computing as your minor or second major using your Unrestricted Elective Credits (UE). NUS has a flexible curriculum structure. So do not be too disheartened even if you end up not in SoC.,
,
You may stand a better chance at smu/ntu."

		Its very unlikely that the 10th percentile cut off will drop the coming year. Yet again, if you have a good maths background (A in E and A maths or relevant poly modules), it could boost your chances. ,
,
In NUS, you can always take up computing as your minor or second major using your Unrestricted Elective Credits (UE). NUS has a flexible curriculum structure. So do not be too disheartened even if you end up not in SoC.,
,
You may stand a better chance at smu/ntu.
	,
,
Thanks for your advice, I would consider my maths as average (both A and E maths B3). I won't be shocked if I didn't get in anyways as I predict the 10th percentile might not fall very far off from 19/20."

,For NTU, they would've sent an email for your enrolment decision, i.e. enrol in Aug 2020 or Special Term etc.,
,
For your case, if you intend to apply for a new course in 2020, their suggestion is to select 'enrol in Aug 2020'. This is to secure your spot in the uni, in case your new application is rejected. ,
If your new application was accepted, they will give you the option to choose between the two.,

I think it works similarly with the other unis, but I can't confirm. DYOD."

Btw, she was an active member of her String Assembly in her Poly time and was also an avid Group Leader of her section. Will this be a considering factor in her quest for a place in SMU?

,Try oversea uni, or apply local uni next yr. For ur case, u may have to leave SG until u get any offer from uni. There's no LTVP for JC graduate. TBH 77.5rp is not high enough to secure a desired course in the big3 for foreigner, unless u try to apply those courses with LOW rp like Chinese or certain Engineering courses... I'm quite shock as u dun even apply for PR during ur studies."

	,
,1) take a gap year but do something that you can present to the uni as achievements.,
2) do the international A levels and try to get all As,
3) or do SATs and get a good score,
4) apply to all 3 unis, and choose courses that are not that popular. (seriously you are an idiot to only apply to NTU). I STRONGLY RECOMMEND TRYING FOR SMU if you just want to get in somewhere.,
5) If you really want to stay here, there are loads of other programmes. Singapore is an education hub. I don't know if you are a PR, but it may cost more if you are not.,
,
-SUSS (Recently have a couple of new undergrad programmes),
-SIT (You can get a ""branded"" degree from the Technical University of Munich),
-ESSEC business school (Somewhat well-known French biz school),
-SIM-GE (UOL, UniOfBuffalo if you wanna go overseas),
-James Cook/MDIS/Kaplan,
-Or just try the Big3 for one more year,
,
Plan wisely and good luck;"

Firstly, email NTU to get the confirmation of placement letter. I don't know whether you can get it immediately, but for me, I only received the confirmation letter on 1st Feb due to they are unsure whether there are enough slots for you. ,
Thus, they will have to wait for the Uni Admission Exercise for Polytechnic Students before ,

Once you get the letter, let your OC/CSM or S1 knows that you would like to apply for disruption. Fill up the paperworks and approval should be within 1-2 weeks if everything goes well. ,

,This year uni is like starting in a month time. Nothing much you can do if your appeal failed.,
,
Not sure how student pass works. But if you need to a school admission letter first before applying, this year is gone case. You can try applying again next year. You can also try private uni but you must check if it's acceptable for student pass.,
,
With regards to your citizenship, yeah, you should have applied earlier if you wanted to stand a better chance. Even if you apply now, you still have to wait for a while, which could be years I think. So better start thinking of alternative options besides SG."

Hi,,
,
,
,
Nursing has probably one of the lower GPA cut off so transferring to a more popular course of course is pretty low chance unless you are exceptional in your nursing first year and have some really good reasons to convince them... but to be fair you did not share your current grade here so... if it is not superb, then appealing is probably waste of time...,
,
,
Instead of appealing, you have to ask yourself what you want... a course you are interested in or a local uni degree.... for some, they did not even have a chance to enter NUS... of course doing something you do not like is also not something easy too...  ,
,
,
,
Do take note that you have used up a year of your government subsidies for undergrad program.... for some, this may have some impact on their choices..."

		In SMU Accountancy. I think the whole “3 vs 4 years” debate comes up every intake, and it’s easy to think linearly and say that NBS > SMU Biz/Acc. However, would like to point out that:,
,
1) Depending on the number of exemptions, one may be able to complete the program in 3 or 3.5 years, rather than four.,
,
2) SMU’s curriculum is more holistic in that you don’t just take courses specific to your domain, but are able to take a second major to learn a complementary discipline (ie Accounting w/ second major in Finance or Finance w/ a second major in Economics, and there are so many other combinations as well). The core modules also address topics that are quite pertinent to self-improvement, which I think is beneficial. ,
,
3) SMU is a management school, and so you get a number of inherent advantages from studying Biz/Acc here. The emphasis on corporate skills, the professors, the school culture, and the proximity to the CBD all contribute to making students more effective management professionals. ,
,
4) SMU may not be known for the hostel experience, but the vibrancy of the CCAs more than makes up for it. ,

Ultimately, I believe the choice has to made by oneself. But I do think the preceding points could definitely aid in one’s research to see what best fits him or her.

		I would suggest u to go NTU instead of SMU as u can finish ur course in 3 years rather than 4 (save 1 year of fees), far location can be solved by staying in hall and lastly, NTU is more well known not just locally but internationally, higher ranked alot more.

		In SMU Accountancy. I think the whole “3 vs 4 years” debate comes up every intake, and it’s easy to think linearly and say that NBS > SMU Biz/Acc. However, would like to point out that:,
,
1) Depending on the number of exemptions, one may be able to complete the program in 3 or 3.5 years, rather than four.,
,
2) SMU’s curriculum is more holistic in that you don’t just take courses specific to your domain, but are able to take a second major to learn a complementary discipline (ie Accounting w/ second major in Finance or Finance w/ a second major in Economics, and there are so many other combinations as well). The core modules also address topics that are quite pertinent to self-improvement, which I think is beneficial. ,

,You sound like one of those nbs fanboys who need to reassure themselves their decision to enroll ,
,
1) 3-years or 4-years both have their pros and cons. You can graduate faster in 3 years and start working earlier, but 4 years lets you do more internships and take more modules. Up to individual preference.,
,
2) The nbs second major is severely limited. It is almost impossible to do a non-traditional second major because you only have 3 years to graduate and very few units for electives.,
,
3) Contrary to popular belief, nbs is not well-known outside Singapore at all ,, although the ntu brand does have some mileage in asia.,
,
4) CCA is a moot point becauase all unis have CCAs. However, it is true that hall life may be an important consideration for some applicants.,
,
And lastly, SMU has way better career services because:,
- They are located in the city, it is easy to get companies to come down or to get students to attend talks,
- Because they are located in the city, it is also easy for their students to do part-time internships,
- They have a much stronger alumni network,
- Their career service office is much more pro-active than nbs,
,
The nbs career office always jokes about how smu students are only good at talking/presentation. But just look at linkedin for the career outcomes of NBS students compared to SMU students. The NBS guy will probably end up in Big4 while the SMU guy is in a bank.,
,
,
For the record, nbs graduate here."
""
"Sorry but reasons like ""career office located in city"" is superior or SMU has a stronger alumni network without substantiation sounds stupid and don't hold too much water.,
,
Both universities are good. But if you want to start working earlier, NBS is a better choice."

,Don't give up trying to appeal because if you really love the course that you applied for, you must fight for it all the way! ,
,
Even if the future appeal outcome is not in your favor, you could also have a back-up plan such as taking a gap year by going for some work experiences or just enjoy life! It wouldn't harm you in any way and at the end of the day, it is up to you to decide how you want to live life to the fullest! , ,

I failed my uni applications last year and had to take a gap year. Thankfully, I gained valuable experiences and it is the biggest turning point in my life. Think about it, you will have the upper hand compared to students who have no prior working experience. Once you graduate, employers will sought for graduates with more experience.,
You can accomplish many things during your gap year. Be it going overseas for a break, gaining work experience, building on your connections related to your field, be exposed to different jobs and giving yourself time to reconsider which field/job is MOST suited for you.,
Not being able to enroll into a uni is NOT the end but thinking that you are at the dead end is THE end."

1. Write to the school directly or a prof and explain why you are such a great fit (questionable chances but who cares at this stage),
2. Sit for SATs, get a high score, and appeal/apply using that,
3. Go to private universities here,

	,
,Hi there! Hmm if you have any other academic certificates or testimonies that you would like to support your appeal statement, you may do so by emailing the admissions team but I think there is a limit also. If I'm not wrong, you must keep the file size within 5MB. Try not to also include documents that you have already provided in the check status menu. All the best for your appeal! Email the admissions team if you have any other queries "

,I checked the NTU List of Acceptable Diplomas and when i entered my diploma course in the search button, it shows a list of programmes that i can apply for and ADM is one of it. But i also noted they mentioned in another page for admission saying  “If you have a Diploma with Merit or Diploma with Distinction, you may apply for any programme in NTU, regardless your diploma (except for LKCMedicine Programme).” that’s why I am concerned about my GPA because i am sure the most i can graduate with is a 3.2.

If your application is successful, you may submit your appeal via online during the appeal period if you wish to change your offered programme.,

,same i got rejected as well. Have you received any offers from other unis? If not, you could try appealing if you really want to get into the course that you hope for in NUS.,
,
For my case, I think I'm gonna wait for my NTU appeal outcome and SMU outcome first before re-thinking."

		Hi, what are these certifications? Was it costly?
	,
,It's AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate. AWS stands for Amazon Web Services which is one of the leading cloud providers. I think this certification exam costs around 150 USD and you have to score at least 720/1000 to pass and get certified in this certification.,
,
Cloud Computing is one of the most in-demand skills in the world right now as companies/organizations are trying to shift their businesses to the cloud from on-premise. But the problem is there's a severe shortage of these ""Cloud Experts"" to help organizations to shift their businesses to the cloud in a more cost-efficient way and other factors."

		Erm...NUS hall life is actually more developed than NTU.,
,
NTU hall life is just joining interhall games.,
,
NUS biz (or even FASS) > NTU linguistics too
	,
,Honestly, I think NUS hall is more packed than NTU's since it's required for you to take up 5/6 CCAs (as I hear from my jc classmates) to maintain your hall stay (unlike in NTU where you are guaranteed 2 years so it's your free choice to join 1 or 2 CCAs if you like or not unless you want to stay all 4 years in NTU).,
,
Also, NUS has 2 different forms of residence (halls and RCs). ,
,
NUS RCs, on the other hand, is pretty chill since you are not forced to take 5/6 CCAs to maintain your hall stay but you gotta take the mods in your RC. And damnn NUS RCs are really atas looking (I only have friends from Yale-NUS and Cinamon college so I'm referring to these 2 RCs). Like their recreational rooms with pool tables, football tables, X-box/Wii/Switch, mahjong tables, pianos/keyboard/guitar etc. and like it just look damn high-class in terms of the settings and interior design (esp. Yale-NUS obviously). It also has aircon rooms unlike NUS halls or so I heard about NUS halls. ,
Like it's really lavish for around the same fees as NUS halls (according to my friend it's 2k per sem also but I'm not sure if it's because she got subsidies or what not). The only bad thing about NUS halls and RCs is their fixed meal plan that you must pay for (that also include extras for friends/fam). I tried Cinamon College food and like it's not that bad but I can't imagine eating it every day.,
,
Of course, NTU halls are cheaper but I guess it's due to location and depends on which kind of halls you stay in (let me just talk about single rooms). Just a brief input of some halls:,
,
Like hall 1/2 probably have the biggest rooms (and maybe one of the cheapest rooms + they got attached toilets so you don't have to share with some terrible people + yays no peeping tom cases possible) and like they are close to Canteen 2 which has really good food, 7-eleven, ATMs, some hair-dresser, and my favourite giant express. Hall 6 is also close to can 2 but like because hall 6 isn't as big as hall 1/2, the no air-con thing in hall 6 really sucks (it's too hot for me). ,
,
Arguably, pioneer and crescent halls are like the most atas looking halls (even better than northhill halls imo and I stay at northhill). Like they have this forest-like serenity and also have a massive lake/pond in the middle of it. Also, their thai food at their canteen is also nice.,
,
Northhill halls aren't that bad besides its location (it's not close to northspine or southspine so you really gotta rely on the bus that seems to have a problem disappearing from the NTU bus app once it is supposedly going to reach northhill). In terms of food, it has a minimart, a terrible canteen and a prata restaurant that's actually not bad till it closes down this sem. Also, it has a terribly crowded gym. The best thing about northhill is that it got lounges almost every alternate. floor for each block and like free aircon + you can use it till whatever timing you want (even at 4 am the air con and lights work).,
,
Then there's the newest cluster of tamarind, meranti and saraca halls. They are not bad in terms of their canteens. And like it's new so you probably don't need to worry so much about creepy crawlies or it being too old/dirty since it's not even 1 year old. (I don't even see much bugs in my room at northhill so I expect less in these 3 halls) And like they got these amazing single rooms with not only aircon but an attached toilet like hall1/2 only way newer and more atas looking. If you can afford the price tho at 590$ per month (the most expensive hall rooms in NTU yet). They have rooms with the attached toilets without aircon too la but omg extravagence pls. ,
,
Halls 3/16 are located just beside NIE and hence really close to northspine as well; so they are close to NIE gym and NIE has one of the cheapest food that's really not bad. Halls 3/16 are pretty nicely renovated too so like it's really quite nice and the aircon can be *cough* really cheap too geddit. Just the food there isn't the best.,
,
Halls 12/13 are quite cool in terms of like how their room floors are like laminated wood?? Most hall rooms are just normal tiled floors I think or whatever it's called. Also, they are quite close to northspine/NIE too. Their aircon are crazily cheap too wink wink. Also, they are known to be a social hall so if you love drinking and what not, I guess this hall is perfect for you.,
,
Halls 4/5 have the biggest air-conditioned rooms and they are the closest to southspine; also, they are very difficult to get.,
,
That's all I know and hope it helps.,
,
Edit: I just saw the 'NUS biz (or even FASS) > NTU linguistics' too thing- I don't know what you mean by equating these but if in terms of cop, yea I guess NUS business is somewhat not the easiest to get in if you get 75 and below (above that, I think there's leeway or smth). However, not sure if NUS FASS > NTU linguistics. Last year, I heard of a PR student who got 80 rp and got interviewed for NTU linguistics. I guess NUS FASS and NTU linguistics are more or less equal in cop. However, really depends on the cohort also. A lot of people in HASS are pretty passionate about their courses just as FASS students are, maybe with the slight exception of some courses known to be taking in people who got rp that barely makes it (around 65-70). For those courses, well if a lot of people goes in with the mentality of 'no choice', I guess it's a self-fulfilling prophecy that many of them won't do well in uni and after."

		hey guys, when choosing for a course, will you all rather choose it for the job prospects/practicality or for your passion? Because right now im having a hard time deciding between NUS FASS(Psych) vs NTU Accountancy... Really nid help!! ,
	,
,Honestly, go for what you can succeed in - even if you take accountancy and it's like a 'safe' path as in there will confirm be a demand for it, the pay depends on the kind of company (which depends on your capability). ,
,
My psych coursemate (hi you who recognised me from my typing style lmao) takes a double major in NTU and according to him if he doesn't get second upper honours minimally, he said there's no point to him taking it. I don't actually get it at first but he works as some higher level shyt at HR and they say being able to do well justify why taking certain degrees (double major/double degree/special courses or programme what not) give you an advantage compared to the people taking normal degrees (or ""less practical"" degrees).,
,
Also anecdotal evidence from my own mum- she takes accountancy but that's not her passion (not just that, she kinda sucks at it- she's more of a arts and social sciences person). And compared to my aunts who work as accountants, her salary was pretty shyt even for what I think for an accountant and hear about in the media (I mean this may not be relevant since it's quite long ago since she's retired pretty long). In a sense, she discouraged me from ever taking accountancy tho she don't mind if I take business."

The ""18 percent) might refer to the quota of places reserved for international students, as in only 18% of university places are available to international students.

,Imo, you seem to be equally interested in both courses (even if it's for different types of reasons- practical, passion etc.),
I would think it's best if you can take both courses and it seems SMU have the greatest flexibility for this (you can easily take up double majors in SMU - easiest among the 3 uni). ,

I feel like if you have to compromise between the 2 courses, you might still feel somewhat regretful as you enter uni."

,ok, i thought that you can appeal online (with an appeal button) but if i were to click it, it doesn't allow me to go in further.  i attended interview end april but status is still processing.  so just wonder come May 24th what do i do if they never reject and never offer."

"hello, I'm currently fretting as I didn't do so well for Alevels and got a 68.75 rp raw. I just recently got rejected from nus and was wondering if i stand a chance if i appeal to nursing as i did not place my choice for nursing in the first round of admissions. I heard that my scores meet the borderline but I'm afraid that the slots would be taken up already. If i applied via da in the first round, in the appeal, would it also reflect my DA?"

Ohh I see, is there any latest period whereby I have to inform the accepting uni that I am no longer interested in their offer? Quite worried that they might think that I'm confirmed to be accepting their offer and cannot remove my acceptance status anymore."

"There's no ""latest period"" as such. As long as you notify them of the withdrawal before Matriculation, there will be no loss to you and they won't mind. If you want to withdraw after Matriculation though, you will lose your Matriculation fees which you pay for Matriculating. You can always withdraw whenever you want just that once you start paying them, you would lose money. So hope that your offer doesn't come after you have Matriculated.,

,Yes, when you receive the results of your admission, and you don’t see your 1st or 2nd choice, but see your 3rd or 4th, it probably means that you were rejected for 1st and 2nd. Hard to say if they will reject, need to compare your gpa against the IGP this year."

,Just curious, because I am applying for IS instead of CS. I went to the NUS Open Day 2019 and spoke to one of the NUS IS professors and he told me that the O level math grade requirement is catered for students studied a non-computing diploma. As for people who studied computing related diploma, he said the O level math requirement will be less emphasized. ,

I not sure how true is this, can anyone verify this?"

		This is my personal opinion but I do think students also play a role in how good the lecture will be; like imagine you go to lecture and majority of the ppl also not even paying attention to the lecture and they just doing their own stuff, I feel like the prof will also be damn sianz to lecture with such an unenthusiastic and uninterested audience. ,
,
Back when I was in JC (so no recorded lecture whatsoever except for prerecorded lectures), there are bio lectures that can be interesting since there's so much cool stuff in bio that they can teach esp with the new syllabus. But generally a lot of the ppl in my class taking bio don't really have that passion for it anyway so their lack of enthusiasm mirrors the lecturers (i think BCME and PCME are the most common combi across all jcs).,
,
I took history also and like honestly, it was the only lecture I was always damn awake in; maybe the lecturers are damn good but also, the ppl in the class are like pretty passionate and ppl don't just passively listen like sponges and there's an interactive feels to it.,
,
So, if you are damn passive and uninterested & so are your coursemates, I bet the lecture will end up being passive over time even if the lecture was initially quite funz.
	,
,Yes, you have a point. I believe in learning through interaction and discussion - mainly the engagement has to be there la  but I do udstd that students behavior also affects lecturers’ enthusiasm too!"

Anyone went for SMU IS Interview before? Please share your experience

"Between NTU's Chemical & Biological Chemistry and Biological Sciences, which course is actually the better one?,
,
I originally put Biological Sciences as my first choice because of interest in biology but was offered Chemistry instead, which is rather tough for me, as I don't really have much of an interest in Chemistry (I toughed it out in Poly, but just the thought of learning it for four years just makes me want to scream really).,
,
Currently, I'm still debating if it's worth it to actually appeal for Biological Science anymore, as I found that Chem graduates actually have better employment rates (and higher median salaries compared to BS graduates - based off the statistics of 2018).,
,
So at this point should I even appeal anymore? Should I just accept this and move on? (I heard the chances of success are really low, and I don't really want to give myself false hope.) "

,This is my personal opinion but I do think students also play a role in how good the lecture will be; like imagine you go to lecture and majority of the ppl also not even paying attention to the lecture and they just doing their own stuff, I feel like the prof will also be damn sianz to lecture with such an unenthusiastic and uninterested audience. ,
,
Back when I was in JC (so no recorded lecture whatsoever except for prerecorded lectures), there are bio lectures that can be interesting since there's so much cool stuff in bio that they can teach esp with the new syllabus. But generally a lot of the ppl in my class taking bio don't really have that passion for it anyway so their lack of enthusiasm mirrors the lecturers (i think BCME and PCME are the most common combi across all jcs).,
,
I took history also and like honestly, it was the only lecture I was always damn awake in; maybe the lecturers are damn good but also, the ppl in the class are like pretty passionate and ppl don't just passively listen like sponges and there's an interactive feels to it.,
,
So, if you are damn passive and uninterested & so are your coursemates, I bet the lecture will end up being passive over time even if the lecture was initially quite funz."

		Hi, the interview that i went was a duo interview with another guy with 2 profs. Before you go in you will receive 2 ""essay"" like questions fr u to ans (random questions) on the paper and notes to discuss later on. The only question they asked me was why NBS? Followed by discussing 1 out of the 2 topic question. You will take turns with your partner to discuss and comment on your respective topic.

Sometimes if the air-con isn't working, then you can see everyone fanning themselves. But I would think larger LTs would be colder and smaller LTs might be less cold (especially when the air-con isn't working). Anyway, you don't have to go to lectures if it's recorded which is like 70% of the time (I think higher for NBS and SBS)."

,Hi hengheng98, though I am not able to find the long post you had asking about advice, I would like to share my two cents nonetheless.,
,
 NUS, NTU, SMU ETC: If you apply for a course in another uni you will still retain your old course spot in the old uni - you will need to email the admissions office of the old uni to rescind your course/scholarship offer, no repercussions involved as long as you haven't matriculated.,
,
 I would advice you to accept the backup offer from SMU first and try again next year for NUS.,
,
 Even though, O Level will not be required for uni admission after 2020, the course that you want to apply will still require you to fulfil some o level subjects requirements.,
,
 ii)Information Security / Information Systems: At least an A2 in GCE 'O' level Elementary Mathematics or at least a B4 grade in GCE 'O' level Additional Mathematics,
,
 As the deadline for private o level is over, you will not be able to take o level this year, so I would recommend you to prepare for o level e and a maths for next year exam.,
,
 This way, you will definitely stand a higher chance of getting NUS offer.,

		Hi! I'm in similar situation. I graduated in 2017, coming from relevant Diploma with Merit CGPA 3.95. ,
I'm a PFP student as well but I do not meet the maths requirement. Thus, I've been trying DA as I have good CCA records (I won several awards in local IT competitions, represented SG in international competition before, worked as freelance developer as well as startup biz as well).,
,
I got invited for DA in 2017, but didn't manage to secure a spot. Applied last year & was rejected without interview and this year is my last year of applying as I managed to disrupt from National Service (I enlisted late). I currently accepted NTU Computer Science. I'm thinking whether to take a gap year to take O Level Maths to increase my chance as well as from Y2020 onwards, O level will not be taken into consideration. However, due to my family circumstances as well as discouragement from friends I most likely will be enrolling into NTU meanwhile just praying for some good news from NUS side. Haha.,

Are you a male or female? ,
If you are a male serving NS, You can accept SMU offer first and reapply next year. ,

		If you’re very very very interested in programming mods, then you should go ahead with NUS IS. As NUS IS needs to take a couple of CS mods which you’ll expose to a couple more of programming languages for instance the C+, C#.,
,
Since you’ll be taking CS mods, you’ll be competing against students from Computer Science. It will be tougher (perhaps?) There’ll also be bell curve in NUS IS. So it’ll prolly be skewed, depending on the cohort. ,
,
For SMU IS, we are only exposed to Python (currently the most popular programming language) and Php (+ object oriented programming) And that’s about it. Unless you’re very interested in hard core programming, then that’s where you’ll choose to venture into the IT side when you choose your majors. However, as of year 1, these are the 2 primary programming languages you’ll be exposed to.,
,
In SMU IS, we do not have bell curve (for IS mods only). It kinda encourages everyone to help up each other and learn from each other. ,
,
And ofc, that itself will not be sufficient. Be it whether you’re in NUS / SMU, you still need to self learn a couple more programming languages outside of the curriculum to gain a better competitive advantage. ,
,
School is just a ‘stepping platform’ for you to start your IT journey. ,
,
Just to be more objective. NUS provides a solid foundation for you to start your IT journey. They are very technical in a sense that there’s a lot of programming modules you’ve to clear. However, for SMU IS, as they always say, we tend to fluff, package ourselves very well and kinda lack the hard-core technical skills. ,
,
So it really depends on your objective. ,

,Thanks for your reply! Yup thats also another critical reason why I hesitate between NUS and SMU. I find NUS better equips its IS graduates as compared to SMU in terms of technical knowledge.

When you log into the portal they’ll put it below your application enquiry with the outcome of your application and an e-letter stating your acceptance which you have to download. It’s different from NTU as they send it via email. But you also have to log in to the portal before viewing the acceptance letter."

		Hello all. NTU undergrad here. Y2 going Y3. The semester ended this week and coming 2 to 3 weeks are exam period. This means the profs have more time to conduct interviews which can even stretch to end May. So for those border line cases, wait patiently. And for those who have multiple offers, please do accept once you are already sure which one you want so that the other slots can be released for other people here anxiously waiting for an offer. All the best everyone.

Hi i attended Smu interview and wonder if i will get offer. And i have a SIT offer already. So acceptance deadline is 24th May.  What if I don't get an offer and never get rejection email from SMU and I have to accept SIT as last option? And eventually SMU rejects me can I still appeal while already accepted SIT? Or SMU offers after 24th May is this possible? Very confused now.  Any advice is much appreciated.

I really hope to get into NUS IS (I am interested in the modules offered) but no news till now so I am already prepared to face the worst scenario. I did receive an offer from SMU so I still got Plan B. ,
,
However, SMU school fees is higher than NUS by over 10k, which really makes me think whether should I take up SMU offer. ,
,
Personally, I like both SMU and NUS but school fees is really a factor that I must take into account of. Moreover, I do not have an extensive knowledge on how SMU IS curriculum. I wonder is it the same as NUS? or does it differ a lot? ,
,
So if NUS rejects me this year, I intend to reject SMU offer, and apply next year to NUS. The reason being university will no longer take into account of O Level result from Y2020 onwards. I was a PFP student and does not have an O Level result thus the long wait or possible rejection from NUS.,
,
So I would like to ask what are some of your thoughts on this? ,
,
1) Should I reject SMU this year and apply for NUS next year? ,
,
2) Do I stand a higher chance in getting accepted if I apply next year? (My CGPA is above 3.9) ,
,
Thank you everyone for reading this long post lol just wanna listen to some of your advices/opinions. Thanks!
	,
,I am curious about something. Why did you even bother to apply for SMU when you SEEM to DISLIKE it? Like u mention that the course fees are high and you INTEND to reject it etc...😂 Cos I won't bother SO MUCH if it is the course that I wanted and in the event that they have already ACCEPTED you.

"If you’re very very very interested in programming mods, then you should go ahead with NUS IS. As NUS IS needs to take a couple of CS mods which you’ll expose to a couple more of programming languages for instance the C+, C#.,
,
Since you’ll be taking CS mods, you’ll be competing against students from Computer Science. It will be tougher (perhaps?) There’ll also be bell curve in NUS IS. So it’ll prolly be skewed, depending on the cohort. ,
,
For SMU IS, we are only exposed to Python (currently the most popular programming language) and Php (+ object oriented programming) And that’s about it. Unless you’re very interested in hard core programming, then that’s where you’ll choose to venture into the IT side when you choose your majors. However, as of year 1, these are the 2 primary programming languages you’ll be exposed to.,
,
In SMU IS, we do not have bell curve (for IS mods only). It kinda encourages everyone to help up each other and learn from each other. ,
,
And ofc, that itself will not be sufficient. Be it whether you’re in NUS / SMU, you still need to self learn a couple more programming languages outside of the curriculum to gain a better competitive advantage. ,
,
School is just a ‘stepping platform’ for you to start your IT journey. ,
,
Just to be more objective. NUS provides a solid foundation for you to start your IT journey. They are very technical in a sense that there’s a lot of programming modules you’ve to clear. However, for SMU IS, as they always say, we tend to fluff, package ourselves very well and kinda lack the hard-core technical skills. ,
,
So it really depends on your objective. ,

	,
,Hi! I'm in similar situation. I graduated in 2017, coming from relevant Diploma with Merit CGPA 3.95. ,
I'm a PFP student as well but I do not meet the maths requirement. Thus, I've been trying DA as I have good CCA records (I won several awards in local IT competitions, represented SG in international competition before, worked as freelance developer as well as startup biz as well).,
,
I got invited for DA in 2017, but didn't manage to secure a spot. Applied last year & was rejected without interview and this year is my last year of applying as I managed to disrupt from National Service (I enlisted late). I currently accepted NTU Computer Science. I'm thinking whether to take a gap year to take O Level Maths to increase my chance as well as from Y2020 onwards, O level will not be taken into consideration. However, due to my family circumstances as well as discouragement from friends I most likely will be enrolling into NTU meanwhile just praying for some good news from NUS side. Haha.,
,
Are you a male or female? ,
If you are a male serving NS, You can accept SMU offer first and reapply next year. ,
I wish you all the best and hope you will get news from NUS soon!"

plus maybe they want to give u interview for ur first choice (which u will prolly get informed of latest by this week) after the first wave of acceptance recently coz ur close to whatever they use to calculate as a score."

		Minors in NTU uses your unrestricted electives, so you will just have higher priority when you choose the modules under the minor during the add/drop period but you can choose not to take them (or if they are already added for your course registration, you can just drop them). You can also declare up to 2 majors during your undergrad years.,
,
You are still considered under a single degree course btw, so no worries (minors aren't considered as a second major/degree). ,

at least that is what I know of for minors?

		At least for myself, NTU psychology has a very positive atmosphere whereby the people are really really really nice and helpful! Unlike in JC where people take A levels like a dog-eat-dog-world, my coursemates and I would collaborate and make notes for our modules in a shared folder, and they will make sure I'm okay so many times (when I'm sick, when I need help with modules I suck at and when i'm not looking good due to some relationship issues etc.). And there's like no such things as closet muggers like in JC; people just actively encourage you to study and ask u to study with them (so no sneks). ,
Also, a lot of people in NTU psych are in WSC (volunteering club), doing RA (research assistant), and take elective modules in NIE (declare minors in early childhood/special needs/youth work/education blah which is related to psych),
Honestly, I love uni so much more compared to JC because of my coursemates HAHA.,
,
I would say, in comparison to NBS, it feel more warmth (coz no sneks).,
Comparing with engineering, I guess it's hard to compare since there's so many diff engin faculty and there's sooooooo many people taking engineering so pretty sure there's a large variance and hence many types of ppl in engin (but using my biased limited sample size, I would think they look more ded compared to psych ppl - psych ppl seem to dress up more fun-ly),
,
Oh ya, culture in NTU in general - study, supper, cca, hall? (+ ppl always queuing for welfare packs, freebies, and NBS shirts),
,
Not sure what else to say about the culture in NTU Psych haha, you need to experience it yourself.

,!!! Sounds really nice , Hehe I am excited now! Thanks and I wish you all the best in pursuing the degree and master!"

To confirm, PFP students are at a disadvantaged to enter NUS as they take into account O level results.

I guess they value all As more than more distinctions but not GPA 4. ,

You have a mix of year 1, year 2 and even year 3 students in core mod classes so it's not representative.,

Anyway, I would say no need to rush core mod classes in year 1 because ,

1) They are not S/Uable,

 1. NTU's CS curriculum is very rigid - you have to take certain specialization mods that aren't very useful for most CS grads like computer graphics, advanced software architecture, compiler techniques. You also need to take engineering math since you're under the engineering faculty.,
 Whereas if you look at NUS's CS curriculum, you'd notice that the compulsory CS mods are all general and to give you an introduction and foundation in CS. You can choose to study those advanced mods in specific focus areas.,
,
 Lastly, unlike in NTU where you can only start taking technical CS electives in your 3rd last semester, in NUS, you can start taking CS focus area mods as long as you completed the prerequisite mods.,
 This helps a lot as students who know what type of tech jobs they want can take relevant electives early to boost their chances of securing their internship after year 2.,
,
 2. NUS S/U system hands down beats NTU.,
,
 3. No need to stay in hall as travelling to NUS isn't as shag as NTU.,
,
 If you noticed, I didn't write anything about rankings because to be frank, judging unis based on rankings that take into account factors other than quality of education or professors is not a good idea."

With placement test no longer an option for applicants from 2018 onwards, there's no more 2nd chances to do psych if you don't ,

Honestly, it really depends on what you mean by better?  ,
,
If you look in terms of RP, the 10th percentile for NTU psych is 77/90 while that for NUS FASS is 73/90. So, well you do have a higher percentage of classmates who do really well for A levels and hence, it may be a quite a competitive/motivating environment to spur you to study. ,
[of course looking at RP is quite lame; however, I feel partly why some people presently think NUS psych is better than NTU psych may be because NTU psych used to be where some people go when they can't enter NUS FASS which probably have a higher 10th percentile a few years ago but for recent years, you can clearly see that's not the case],
,
On the other hand, world university rankings for NUS and NTU psychology isn't actually very different and also not really that impressive, truthfully. If you really am passionate about psychology and can afford it, going to US to study psych is of course the best.,
,
If you are looking at the S/U system, hands down NUS wins.,
,
If you live far from both NTU and NUS such that you are looking at hall stays, obviously NTU halls are better since it is not only cheaper but guaranteed (without any commitment) for 2 years.,
,
If you are looking at prestige, the name NUS is probably more WOW among your friendly neighbourhood uncles and aunties but maybe not as wow if your friendly relatives with kids also in uni know you are from FASS (OK DON'T KILL ME but everyone knows how ppl make fun about ppl from arts and social sci in sg). But I mean, you choose to go to the faculty, not for the prestige but passion right so heck care them. ,
,
Honestly, i don't think there's much to compare between NTU and NUS psych rn except your own needs (travel time, what kind of culture suits you most, etc.)
	,
,Thank you for your explanation! It was very helpful. Can I ask how the culture in NTU is, especially in psychology?"

After the online application, I am suppose to mail them the supporting documents but not sure when as the information on their website was a bit confusing for me. Called their financial aid office up and they told me to mail the supporting documents only after getting matric number. Hope this clears your doubt.

		Can i know the difference betweern GERPEs and GERUE?,

So the problem is the grade of your UEs are affecting and pulling down your overall gpa, instead of the cores modules?
	,
,GERPEs are prescribed electives, UEs are unrestricted electives, I’ve heard of pottery classes, but not very sure as of now if it’s still available. Example, I took astrology when I first enrolled, since people told me it was easy as there are questions banks available. Turns out it was damn content heavy and there r quite a number of ppl who S/U the mod. It rly depends on the mod and cohort whether it is able to pull your gpa up or down, which is a risk imo.,
,
Honestly there is no much difference going direct y2 or y1. You would still have to take requisite modules so you won’t be “lagging” behind if that’s what you’re worried of."

		Have to address this point. FASS takes in students based on faculty than major so hence, the lower RP. ,

I think it's a better system anyway. Anyone who wants to do psych can do so but they will be cleared away by Y1 anyway.,
,
By the time you are taking higher-level modules, the bell curve is frequently in the 70+ range anyway.
	,
,That's true but I know of a few people who are taking advantage of this much lower RP to get into psych in NUS due to their inability to get into NUS science (obviously I don't get the logic- why is it ""no choice"" have to go into NUS psych as quoted from what my juniors say- a bit indignant since a lot of us psych majors actually went in with a passion or at least in NTU psych which is thus reflected in the higher 10th percentile RP of 77 which was the same as NUS science when I last applied- it shows that a lot of those who entered ntu psych could have gone for numerous other courses but chose ntu psych) ,
tho, it seemed like rp for NUS science 10th percentile have risen this yr.,
,
I use the point of rp to just illustrate the point about choice - that when ntu psych first started which isn't super duper long ago, some of those who entered ntu psych was because they couldn't get into nus fass- but now it's the reverse.,
,
Choice is related to passion anyways coz not everyone get to choose where they want to go and hence chase their passion, and this also is to support my point that you replied to that there is really motivating environment spurred by passion.,
,
This point is not to put down FASS (if you feel offended) but to explain why some people may think NTU psych isn't that good compared to NUS psych- in which one of the reasons is due to some of those in NTU psych ,couldn't, get into NUS FASS ,in the past, aka rejects (NTU psych was ,BBB/C ,for the ,2012, intake while NUS FASS was BBB/B for the 2012 intake; currently, NTU psych is AAC/C for the 2018 intake and NUS FASS is BBC/B for the 2018 intake)"

	,
,Technically, they are right. There is no limit to vacancy but it all depends on the bell curve. That's how they limit the number of psych undergraduates.,
,
With placement test no longer an option for applicants from 2018 onwards, there's no more 2nd chances to do psych if you don't get a B-,
,
I must emphasize it's B- hor, not B. Sounds insignificant but it does make a lot of difference."

Not very sure about EEE, since I’m from MAE. But the difference between me now, and my y1 friends, I take 4-5 mods in a sem, more time to focus on each mod.

		Hi I am a from the 2016 batch who took the A levels,
,
I enlisted in NS in Jan 2017 and ORDed in NOV 2018. Being an NSF, i had 3 windows to apply for my courses.,
,
Some info about me: I had a RP of 80 from my A levels, but my H2 subjects were all Bs. I took a subj combi of PCME, where econs was my H1.,
,
Basically in the first window, i applied for chem eng in NUS and i got offered for that course so i quickly accepted it, being the course i wanted at that time.,
,
The second window, i didnt apply for a new uni nor change my course,
,
The third window, which is this year , i tried to apply for new courses in NUS, which was Food Science and Pharmaceutical Science which i knew it was difficult to enrol in but i wanted to try to see my luck as those 2 were what i had the most interest in, and i thought that even if i didn't make it in, i still had chem eng to fall back on.,
,
This was where i made 2 fatal mistakes, potentially ending my dream,
,
The first mistake i made was that i didn't read the NUS website properly whereby they stated that if you are being offered for a new course, your old course will automatically be removed and if you reject your new course, you will be left with no course to enrol in for the upcoming semester. This basically means that i was forced to accept my new course,
,
Talking about my new course, this was where my 2nd devastating mistake came in. After putting pharm sci and food sci as my first and second choice respectively, as i didn't know( my first mistake) about the NUS website, i decided to fill up the rest of the choices. I had business for third, computer sci for forth and FASS for fifth. And guess what, i got offered into FASS...,
,
Being a sci student since pri sch all the way to JC, i can say that my interests lie in Science related subjects and i have totally no experience or knowledge in the field of ARTS. I know that if i am forced to take FASS this year, i will struggle for the 4 years that i study in uni(because i really dont have a major i want to take in FASS) and eventually my life will be fked up.,
,
I can also choose to delay 1 year and reapply again next year, and this time i will apply for chem eng but im scared of wasting my time if i dont get my desired choice and also im being left behind by my peers.,
,
I called the NUS number earlier but they told me all i can do is to appeal during the appeal period. But they told me it's subjected to supply and demand and i do know engineering has waned over the past few years compared to the rising demand of the tech savy courses which means the cohort size for engineering will be smaller as a result.,
,
I checked the IGP for 2017 and 2019, i compared it and the cohort size is indeed smaller.,
,
I am really afraid now as i do not want FASS( the only reason why i put that as fifth was because i just considered economics) but i know i wont be able to study and be an economist in the future. It is just not my cup of tea.,
I really regret not reading the website properly and knowing beforehand the details.,
,
Any kind souls can help me with this situation? Please do not flame because i want as many solutions as i can have to go back to chem eng.
	,

		I'm not sure about NTU, but I can share some from my perspective as an SMU Accountancy student.,
,
,Similarities,
,1. Content:, NTU and SMU accounting modules are similar according to my NTU Accountancy friends.  More or less the same, but the depth may vary according to the electives taken. ,
,
,2. Seminar style: ,SMU has it for all classes. NTU has it, but I'm not sure.,
,
,3. Exemptions:,
- For professional qualifications, for SMU, you can get 12 out of 15 exemptions (provided you pass the requisite papers) for ICAEW.,
- For NTU, I'm not sure, but I've a friend who took advanced tax and (i heard) is exempted from CA Singapore's Tax paper. (Need to confirm.),
,
,
,
,Differences,
,1. Cost,
SMU = $11k per annum for 4 years = $44k,
NTU = $8k per annum for 3 years = $24k,
Yup the cost difference is quite large (assuming we don't factor in hostel fees).,
,
,2. Exemptions,
- This is more applicable if you're a poly student.,
If your poly's CGPA is >= 3.8, you can get a maximum of 10+ exemptions from SMU. This means you can graduate in 3 years from SMU even without overloading modules. ,
,
,3. Location,
- SMU is more accessible, unless you stay in the west then NTU is more accessible.,
,
,4. Ability to SU modules!,
- SMU: Has the option to SU two elective modules only when you file for graduation. ,
- NTU: Can SU some electives according to their website. ,
,
,5. Graduate starting pay,
Already mentioned by SiaoLengKeng earlier in this thread, the starting pay for big 4 for both NTU and SMU graduates are similar. $3,000+ for audit.,
,
,6. Other misc requirements,
- SMU has a compulsory 80 hours community service requirement + 1x overseas trip requirement.,
,
,
Overall, if we compare just by cost alone, NTU would be better because it is more cost efficient, but if we consider other factors, then there's no uni that's ""better"". It'll depend on your personal preference!

		Ah I see. Thanks for the reply! The S/U option sounds really great in NUS and now that you write this, I am leaning toward it too (??). I am just concern about the Masters because I don't intend to do one in SG (too competitive). I know NUS is recognised globally, but do you know if NTU is recognised globally enough to do Master in UK universities?
	,
,NTU should be recognized since it's higher than a lot of other UK universities as well. You can look up the UK universities yourself and see if they specify anything, or contact them. But I'm 99% sure it's recognized. Ik of ntu grads who went overseas for Masters/Phds!"

would recommend NTU Acc because it can be completed in 2.5 years if you plan your modules well. If you are targetting to go big 4, it doesnt matter which local uni acc you enroll in, same pay and standard progression. The 1.5 years head start can be worth 2 promotion cycle in big 4 because you can grad in dec (just in time for audit peak). When your peers who went SMU/NUS acc just start out as audit associate 1 with 3k pay, you are already senior associate 1 with 4k+ pay. From this point of view (Taking into account of opportunity cost), you could see that the true starting pay of an NTU grad can be significantly higher than SMU/NUS acc grad,

,Yup, it's an environment I like. I chose SMU 3 years ago because:,
1. It's central, and I stay in the East so its accessible.,

2. School is small, so easier to walk around, no need for shuttle buses.,

Of course, not all students are vocal. And I realized joining SMU won't necessarily mold you to be more vocal.,
If you'd like to develop speaking skills, perhaps joining a public speaking club like Toastmasters would be more helpful. And NTU has few rather established ones too!,

5. ""More time"" to explore different career options: like,
(a) banking and finance,
(b) consultancy,
(c) tax,
(d) accounting and reporting, etc.,
Some students would use their 4 years to explore different possible career options, and by elimination, find the one they like and pursue it.,

If you have no worries about doing really badly in uni, the direct honors isn't really that important since you can easily qualify it if you hit a certain gpa in NUS (3.0/5.0). NTU honours degree with a really low GPA isn't seen favourably, anyway. So imo, it may not be that important for you.,
,
I'm personally leaning towards NUS simply because it's near my place, and I would like to familiarise myself with the clinical psychology department (since NUS offers a Masters). The S/U option for NUS is pretty good too, you can look at your grades and choose which subjects you don't want to count in your gpa. But in NTU, you must choose it before seeing those grades. Most of my coursemates are upset about this as well, but they're probably going to go with NTU. ,
,
As I took statistics and intro to psych in poly, amongst other psych modules (duh), I think i'm confident in getting a B and higher? But of course, I am pretty fearful that something may happen during these tests. That's the main thing that is making me doubt my choice at the moment. ,
	,
,NUS allows you to S/U a total of 8 modules, twice the number of NTU in addition to being able to wait for results before S/Uing.,
,
If I was under the NTU system, I would have S/Ued a sociology module that I got an A for ,
,
As for ""doing psych immediately"", I don't see the rush. The two intro modules helps build up a decent foundation and there are general education modules and basket modules to clear anyway.,
,
Not to mention, the NUS system allows freedom to explore different kinds of combination. ,
,
As for whether NUS or NTU is better, there's not much difference. NUS psych don't care if NTU psych is better or not and I doubt NTU psych cares if NUS is better or not. ,
,
I know some friends who rush to clear their psych mods but for the most part, many prefer to spread it out over semesters to not overload.,
,
Nobody wants to do statistics 2, abnormal psychology, Biological Psychology, cognitive psychology, developmental psychology and social psychology in one go ,
,
The content alone is enough to kill you when you are dealing with bell curves of 70-80 regularly."

"Hi I am a from the 2016 batch who took the A levels,
,
I enlisted in NS in Jan 2017 and ORDed in NOV 2018. Being an NSF, i had 3 windows to apply for my courses.,
,
Some info about me: I had a RP of 80 from my A levels, but my H2 subjects were all Bs. I took a subj combi of PCME, where econs was my H1.,
,
 Basically in the first window, i applied for chem eng in NUS and i got offered for that course so i quickly accepted it, being the course i wanted at that time.,
,
The second window, i didnt apply for a new uni nor change my course,
,
The third window, which is this year , i tried to apply for new courses in NUS, which was Food Science and Pharmaceutical Science which i knew it was difficult to enrol in but i wanted to try to see my luck as those 2 were what i had the most interest in, and i thought that even if i didn't make it in, i still had chem eng to fall back on.,
,
This was where i made 2 fatal mistakes, potentially ending my dream,
,
The first mistake i made was that i didn't read the NUS website properly whereby they stated that if you are being offered for a new course, your old course will automatically be removed and if you reject your new course, you will be left with no course to enrol in for the upcoming semester. This basically means that i was forced to accept my new course ,
,
Talking about my new course, this was where my 2nd devastating mistake came in. After putting pharm sci and food sci as my first and second choice respectively, as i didn't know( my first mistake) about the NUS website, i decided to fill up the rest of the choices. I had business for third, computer sci for forth and FASS for fifth. And guess what, i got offered into FASS...,
,
Being a sci student since pri sch all the way to JC, i can say that my interests lie in Science related subjects and i have totally no experience or knowledge in the field of ARTS. I know that if i am forced to take FASS this year, i will struggle for the 4 years that i study in uni(because i really dont have a major i want to take in FASS) and eventually my life will be fked up.,
,
I can also choose to delay 1 year and reapply again next year, and this time i  will apply for chem eng but im scared of wasting my time if i dont get my desired choice and also im being left behind by my peers.,
,
I called the NUS number earlier but they told me all i can do is to appeal during the appeal period. But they told me it's subjected to supply and demand and i do know engineering has waned over the past few years compared to the rising demand of the tech savy courses which means the cohort size for engineering will be smaller as a result.,
,
I checked the IGP for 2017 and 2019, i compared it and the cohort size is indeed smaller.,
,
I am really afraid now as i do not want FASS( the only reason why i put that as fifth was because i just considered economics) but i know i wont be able to study and be an economist in the future. It is just not my cup of tea.,
I really regret not reading the website properly and knowing beforehand the details.,
,
Any kind souls can help me with this situation? Please do not flame because i want as many solutions as i can have to go back to chem eng."

		Hello! So sorry to butt in but I saw this post and was curious. I am having the same issue as you (if I am accepted into FASS). But I have heard from seniors that NTU psych is btr...? I wondered if you did, because honestly both sounds good to me.
	,
,In terms of the quality of the education, it doesn't seem like one is better than the other (although NUS Psychology/Social Sciences is ranked 10 spots higher, the last I checked).,
,
But some top students I know are choosing NTU simply because they would rather start doing psych instead of waiting to claim their major. This is the key reason why people flock to NTU.,
,
If you have no worries about doing really badly in uni, the direct honors isn't really that important since you can easily qualify it if you hit a certain gpa in NUS (3.0/5.0). NTU honours degree with a really low GPA isn't seen favourably, anyway. So imo, it may not be that important for you.,
,
I'm personally leaning towards NUS simply because it's near my place, and I would like to familiarise myself with the clinical psychology department (since NUS offers a Masters). The S/U option for NUS is pretty good too, you can look at your grades and choose which subjects you don't want to count in your gpa. But in NTU, you must choose it before seeing those grades. Most of my coursemates are upset about this as well, but they're probably going to go with NTU. ,
,
As I took statistics and intro to psych in poly, amongst other psych modules (duh), I think i'm confident in getting a B and higher? But of course, I am pretty fearful that something may happen during these tests. That's the main thing that is making me doubt my choice at the moment. "

Just a few questions,,

Those GERPEs can be S/U so it wont affect the gpa much right? ,
,
And what the difference between dropping modules and graduating in 4 yrs for direct yr 2 compared to starting everything from scratch at y1?,
,
My concern is that I am unable to cope, and I tink my fundamentals are weak as i just yayapapaya my way through in my poly years. So does going y1 and retaking modules that i can exempted a better choice even thou I had taken them in my poly courses?
	,
,That was what I thought. Turns out Maths I and II is way harder than Maths A (direct y2 mod) you only have 12 AUs that u can S/U. If you get in choose the y1 route, you would be taking 9 GERPEs, 12 GERUE. It’s def not sufficient. ,
,
Not very sure about EEE, since I’m from MAE. But the difference between me now, and my y1 friends, I take 4-5 mods in a sem, more time to focus on each mod. As compared to them 5-6 mods in a sem, having to take a lot more UEs. personally don’t rly have a lot of interest in the UEs as I find it very time consuming."

		Trust me, go for direct route. If you cannot cope, can choose to drop modules and grad in 4 years. If you choose the year 1 route, you are required to go through a lot of GERPEs and if I’m not wrong it’s 10+ AUs of unrelated mods, eg. astrology, business 101 etc u can read up more on those. But those mods are quite time consuming as well. If your main concern is unable to cope, trust me y1 is not any better.

But those mods are quite time consuming as well. If your main concern is unable to cope, trust me y1 is not any better. In my first application, I appeal to go for year 1, ended up dropping out and applied to direct y2 again."

,Hi all, seems like there have been quite a few posts asking about the interview.,
,
You'll first be shown into a seminar room with about 50 other candidates and a group number (about 7-8 people in a group).,
,
Next, they'll take you to another room where you'll read an article (not allowed to discuss mine, but the topic is quite broad and relevant to current affairs) and have time to discuss the article with your groupmates.,
,
Lastly, you'll then be shown into another seminar room with 2 profs. The profs got us to introduce ourselves and then got us to discuss how we felt about the article and the discussion took off from there with occasional input from a prof.,
,
The idea is to see how you speak, process your thoughts, defend your ideas and to get a basic idea of whether you're the type of person who can ,meaningfully contribute , to a conversation. ,
,
The whole process will take about 1 1/2 - 2 hours depending on your prof.,

For law, it’s abt $12k a year x 4 years versus $40k a year in UK.
	,
,Only know local medicine is around 35k per year now"

Do you already have Telegram? SMU students mostly uses Telegram, so if you have one, we can chat there instead ,
(can just pm me your tele username),
,
,SMU Accountancy's course structure,
,Financial Accounting,
For accounting modules, there will be group work for almost every module, except for Financial Accounting, which is the 1st accounting mod SOA students will have to take. ,
,
There, you'll have 2 quizzes and 1 assignment instead of a group project as you slowly get used to accounting, which shouldn't be too difficult for poly students like you (if you're careful and hardworking).,
,
,Higher-level accounting modules,
Other modules like Financial Reporting and Analysis and Intermediate Financial Reporting will all have group projects AND in-class tests.,
,
Types of group projects will vary by prof, and this is where having seniors who have taken these prof will help (past project references!)"

		I ve been interested in Physics since i was i  sec sch. Tho many of my friends are not fond of the course due to the lack of job prospects. What are the job prospects and why did u chose Physics  if u dont mind me asking.
	,
,Ah that's nice.,
With regards to job prospects, I'll say that there are those who graduate with a physics degree but do something completely unrelated after that (eg: finance),
There are those who enter slightly related fields (eg:IT/engineering/teaching),
And there are those who enter niche areas (eg: medical physicist/nanotech+semiconductor research),
The job prospects are actually decent. Perhaps it is the lack of clear career paths that makes people assume that physics graduates can't find jobs. (unlike something concrete like engineering degree -> engineering job) ,
,
I chose physics because I like it, I enjoy learning more about how the universe works (typical answer but yeah)"

,interview question is really just ""Why linguistics"" after that it really depends on how you answer and the professor will ask questions accordingly, he really just wants to get to know you and see if you're a good fit for linguistics. He also will discuss about the essay you wrote before, so like make sure you don't write gibberish cause yeah.... my essay question was about animals and how they communicate but really they're just testing how good your command of English is. ,

,Congrats on pulling up your GPA but tbh, I think schools will only look at your overall GPA. They won't even care if you scored 4.0 in your 5th sem.,
,
Considering last year's NTU IGP for Physics at 10th percentile is 3.52, you are way off and it'll be really hard. Won't say it's impossible because only the school's admission team will have all the statistics/data/info on how they accept students. ,
,
So unless you applied through DA with your achievements/CCAs, interview is a possibility, otherwise I would say it's tough.,

Good luck and keep working hard. "

		I'm from the AY16/17 batch, a year 3 student, so I can answer any questions you have.,

For your interview, you'll have a faculty and a senior student/alumnus as your interviewers. ,
The interview is to assess, roughly, whether you're a good fit for the school. ,
,
,Tips,
1. Do read up a little on what accountancy entails, skim through the modules and think of some questions to ask your interviewers.,
,
2. Draft a simple response for the ""tell me about yourself question"".,
Use this opportunity to share more important facts about yourself, perhaps 3 points, such as:,
a. ,Past:, What have you done? (JC/Poly),
b. ,Present:, What're you currently doing? Part-Time job?,
c. ,Future: ,Plans? Thoughts about your degree choice. (Why accountancy 1st? If not, why the 1st choice for your application?),
,
From here, the interviewers may ask questions about what you've said, but this should be quite chill. ,
,
3. Don't say you choose accountancy because your parents told you to and other killer answers and you should be fine!

		Hey there! I picked ntu over smu too.,
I saw someone saying that you'll have a huge culture shock if you went ntu compared to smu. I personally don't think so. I was from poly too, and I didn't feel that it was really difficult to adapt. It's like poly but harder , . The classes are simply lectures, tutorials, seminars. If im not wrong, both uni place heavy emphasis on speaking up in classes or else, you'll get marked down. ,
I find it easy? to adapt and usually i take some time to adapt to a new environment. The first week is usually the hardest.
	,
,did you have an acc background in poly? i've been offered a spot in ntu acc but i'm hesitating (i'm still waiting for a reply from nus) bc i only took one acc mod back in y2 of poly & my seniors have told me that acc is a course which has relatively high requirements (and if that particular field of studies is not my cup of tea, it could be extremely torturous.)"

Is your friend really keen on the aspects of clinical psychology (I guess right now he or she could be interning at pathlight or edens, or actively volunteers at the relevant organizations like VSA)? If he does show that much passion in that field, with a good enough GPA, i don't think he needs to worry too much about which uni he's from to gain masters in clinical psych (being part of these organizations also allow you to gain relevant connections/recommendations in that field). ,

I'm not going, but I'll have an interview with them 2 weeks later. Will they host another 'discovery day' for ppl like me, if accepted?,
Wonder why they don't wanna wait for us to finish the interview first then can do it together. Hahah. But I suspect we may not have that 'discovery day'. ,

Enjoy!

If you are just trying to enter psych coz you think its interesting and only able to see its traditional path of clinical psychology (and not understanding what else is there to psychology), i think going nus fass is good so you can declare majors in other arts and social science should you realize you dont get at least a certain cap (e.g. 4.5/5.0) by the end of year 2 semester 1."

		Hey are you from the previous batch (AY18/19)?
	,
,I'm from the AY16/17 batch, a year 3 student, so I can answer any questions you have.,
,
For your interview, you'll have a faculty and a senior student/alumnus as your interviewers. ,
The interview is to assess, roughly, whether you're a good fit for the school. ,
,
,Tips,
1. Do read up a little on what accountancy entails, skim through the modules and think of some questions to ask your interviewers.,
,
2. Draft a simple response for the ""tell me about yourself question"".,
Use this opportunity to share more important facts about yourself, perhaps 3 points, such as:,
a. ,Past:, What have you done? (JC/Poly),
b. ,Present:, What're you currently doing? Part-Time job?,
c. ,Future: ,Plans? Thoughts about your degree choice. (Why accountancy 1st? If not, why the 1st choice for your application?),
,
From here, the interviewers may ask questions about what you've said, but this should be quite chill. ,
,
3. Don't say you choose accountancy because your parents told you to and other killer answers and you should be fine!"

		if you use your 5th sem results to apply in 2020 intake and received a rejection letter from the uni, you have no choice but to look for other alternatives or re-apply with 2021 intake (which you will apply with 6th sem results since you have graduated from poly by then),

But, considering how NTU civil engineering igp is >3.49 (unless the IGP God decides to **** on you and increase for next year's intake), likelihood you should have a high chance esp when you are from a related course. ,

Ask yourself which uni you really really want to go to? if NUS is your to-go uni, then wait for the offer result otherwise you still have NTU's offer to accept. At least you're better than most of us here. We haven't even gotten an offer from any uni yet.,

		Thanks very much for the great insights that you have shared with us here! To add on, all the best in your university journey as a year 1 student studying psych in NTU! Really enjoyed the process of exchanging views! ,
	,
,Oh, and i forget to add, according to one of my TA (those currently on their path to PhD), to get into clinical and criminal psychology (the two most competitive branch for post-grad), you would first apply for some assistant role under some certified psychologist in that field before you can undertake master's. In both cases, it requires you to be able to analyze and read research papers and calculate/understand the statistical results for the papers (this will be under their technical interviews). Therefore, to successfully pursue a path in clinical or criminal psychology, it is very important to be able to be critical in reading research papers and also being good in your statistics HAHA (i would think both the NUS and NTU psychology do emphasize on this),
,
I would urge you to take on research assistant roles when you enter university to allow you to be more familiar with the roles.,
,
Additionally, to kind of understand better which uni you would be more inclined to, FASS openhouse (the second openhouse) would occur somewhere in may if I don't remember wrongly! You can then get a better idea of how psychology is like (you can ask the psych seniors there).,
,
Btw I didn't choose FASS psychology not because of any supposed flaws it has in comparison to the other universities, but rather I just feel the FASS open house doesnt send off the right feels for me as NTU's (this is very superficial lel but I feel having the right feels is very important to me)"

		Hi there! I would like to thank you for your fervent reply  Really much appreciated with you providing me the background information that I needed to understand.,

Just to know another thing, what are the possible career options that are specific to the different unis, maybe since you are a year 1 studying psych in ntu, maybe you could share what are the prospects that ntu is specifically specializing in and what are some of your career interests that you have thought of that suits the NTU's psych experiences.
	,
,I know NUS offers masters in clinical psychology (one of the only 2 uni that offers that besides JCU- a private university, and according to my academic mentor, the syllabus for JCU masters isn't very recommendable??? I'm can't really remember what he said),
,
However, NTU is striving to open a masters in criminal/forensic psychology or smth lidat (to make itself stand out as well, they have been bringing professors with pHD in criminology in recent years to further that goal),
,
A lot of my coursemates are interested in the path of educational psychology (i think there is a masters program in NIE for that),
,
There is some hearsays i cannot verify (SO PLS DONT FAULT ME FOR THAT), but I do hear for NUS psychology, some people are NUS science rejects or smth; ,
however, in NTU psych, since last year the 10th percentile for NUS science and NTU psych is the same (for A level grads at least), you may expect most people in NTU psych to be very much passionate and sure about going into psychology (there are also several medalists from NP/TP poly psych during my batch),
So what im saying is it might be more competitive here as a result (especially with a lot of people here being really passionate about psych!),
,
In my opinion, besides all these factors, NTU and NUS psychology are not very different in career prospects- it is really how you create chances for yourself (taking up research assistant roles, volunteering, doing independent research- URECA Ntu - you can search this up!),

I would urge you to consider the school culture and distance from your home too!"

		Hi, im currently a y1 psych student in NTU! I believe NTU/NUS would be a better choice given your goals and aims in life!,
,
In ntu, besides taking the psych core mods, many NTU psych majors also take up NIE mods as their minors (such as in counselling, special needs, early childhood, youth pathopsychology, educational psychology and the list goes on HAHA),
,
In nus, i believe there are social work modules that you can take either as a second major, minor or free electives (which seems to suit your passion of helping others!),
,
I feel that SMU is more geared towards business and may not necessarily suits your future career aspirations (not because it's not as good but it doesn't seem in line with your goals),
,
Also, maybe you can take into consideration the environment you work best in and maybe travelling time (because tbh, there shouldn't be that much diff between the 3 uni in terms of prestige- psychology in the 3 uni aren't ranked very highly in the world actually- most of my coursemates would love to enrol in overseas uni if they got the $$$) ,
,
also, I am not in the position to speak for poly students since Im from the JC route (so im not very sure ^^""; all I know is that NUS FASS cop is BBC/B and NTU psych cop is AAC/C to apply; I didnt apply to SMU psych- however, i heard it's based more on interviews rather than just your rp like for NTU/NUS? Im not very sure),
,
Actually, you may also consider that NTU psych is a direct honours track, and direct honours is basically what it is; however, if you are not planning to take masters (in which having honours makes it easier to), you should save your money and just go NUS FASS (3 years if you cant/dont want to get honours),
,
Hope this helps! ,

Afaik, DA is only for those borderline results which mine is. If your GPA is higher, you could get through with merit, no interview needed. Just another possible scenario."

"Maybe they do. We don't exactly know what the universities take into account or not. However, your GPA is good enough so you don't have to stress out about the distinctions.

,I'm in NYP and they don't offer prizes for distinctions at all. So to answer your question, no, I didn't.,

However, for project modules, if my project is deemed good enough for a distinction, I'll have to attend a ""Outstanding Project Presentation"" which is also known as ""Distinction Presentation"" and present to a panel of judges which consists of the Course Manager, Course Coordinator, Moderator and tutors from all classes. They'll then decide if I'm worthy of a Distinction for the project module. ,
,
I was wondering why do people of high authority (Course Manager and etc) bother to arrange and attend the ""Distinction Presentation"" amidst their busy schedule if Distinctions don't matter to uni at all... or why would all polys even bother to issue distinctions in the first place if they don't help at all.

,In my opinion, distinction only matter if you are comparing two GPA 4 students. The first GPA 4 student doesnt have any distinction for any modules while the second GPA 4 student has more distinctions then clearly the latter will be better. ,

Don't be disheartened man. I think for 3.9x student, you should focus on building your resume for scholarship. Admission into Uni shouldn't be a problem so long as you meet their O Level grade requirements for certain courses."

		Hi guys,,
,
I was just wondering if you could give me some comments on which university would suit my interest or passion better from your point of view or experiences.(As a guideline, I have applied for NTU Psych with 2nd major in bio science/ SMU SOSS/ NUS FASS),
,
Facts about myself:,
1. I grew fondly for social science (i.e. psychology) even though I am a poly student who studies accountancy and have a mixture of accounting and business knowledge.,
,
2. I feel that I want to study with a deeper meaning and that it would benefit both society and myself. (I love to make people smile and be happy, thinking on the positive side),
,
3. I would not only just basically want to study on psychology, I want to expand my knowledge such as taking extra courses that would broaden my career prospects.,
,
The above facts are there to briefly describe what are my thoughts now because I do not want to regret choosing the wrong course in the end but still I'm planning to enter a local uni as of now. I would really appreciate any feedbacks or suggestions from any point of view. ,
,
Thanks guys! ,
	,
,
  Hi, im currently a y1 psych student in NTU! I believe NTU/NUS would be a better choice given your goals and aims in life!,
,
In ntu, besides taking the psych core mods, many NTU psych majors also take up NIE mods as their minors (such as in counselling, special needs, early childhood, youth pathopsychology, educational psychology and the list goes on HAHA),
,
In nus, i believe there are social work modules that you can take either as a second major, minor or free electives (which seems to suit your passion of helping others!),
,
I feel that SMU is more geared towards business and may not necessarily suits your future career aspirations (not because it's not as good but it doesn't seem in line with your goals),
,
Also, maybe you can take into consideration the environment you work best in and maybe travelling time (because tbh, there shouldn't be that much diff between the 3 uni in terms of prestige- psychology in the 3 uni aren't ranked very highly in the world actually- most of my coursemates would love to enrol in overseas uni if they got the $$$) ,
,
also, I am not in the position to speak for poly students since Im from the JC route (so im not very sure ^^""; all I know is that NUS FASS cop is BBC/B and NTU psych cop is AAC/C to apply; I didnt apply to SMU psych- however, i heard it's based more on interviews rather than just your rp like for NTU/NUS? Im not very sure),
,
Actually, you may also consider that NTU psych is a direct honours track, and direct honours is basically what it is; however, if you are not planning to take masters (in which having honours makes it easier to), you should save your money and just go NUS FASS (3 years if you cant/dont want to get honours),
,
Hope this helps! "
""
"You won't lose your SMU spot as long as you accept it before the acceptance window closes while waiting for the NTU appeal outcome. You won't lose your SMU offer just because you appealed to NTU. As for chances of appeal success, that is more contentious and many have said it does not work but there have also been many stories of appeal success. What I will say is that use something in your appeal which you have not used in your application yet to make your appeal stronger. No use telling the admissions team stuff they already know. Good luck!,
,
More information: ""If you apply for a new course within the same uni and are successful, you-,
,
-> NUS: -automatically lose your spot in the old course.,
,
-> NTU: -get to choose between your old and new course in the joint acceptance portal,
,
• NUS, NTU, SMU ETC: If you apply for a course in another uni you will still retain your old course spot in the old uni - you will need to email the admissions office of the old uni to rescind your course/scholarship offer, no repercussions involved as long as you haven't matriculated."".

		You won't lose your SMU spot as long as you accept it before the acceptance window closes while waiting for the NTU appeal outcome. You won't lose your SMU offer just because you appealed to NTU. As for chances of appeal success, that is more contentious and many have said it does not work but there have also been many stories of appeal success. What I will say is that use something in your appeal which you have not used in your application yet to make your appeal stronger. No use telling the admissions team stuff they already know. Good luck!

		I would say your chances are relatively high to get into NTU. I think you’ll definitely get into one of those courses above. But for psychology, maybe not.

,It actually depends on which uni you r planning to enrol. I withdrawn from NTU from a 4 year programme after 1 sem in 2018, receiving TG of 8 sems. Which leaves me 7 more sems of TG. This year I enrolled in a direct year 2 course, which has a total of 6 sems. However, I’m planning to extend by 1/2 sems of study as I didn’t want to over stress myself. ,
,
For NTU, if you delay by 1 semester, tuition fees will be capped at 120% of the subsidised fee, 2nd semester at 150% of the subsidised fee and so on. And yup, since you alr used up 2 sems of TG, you are only left with 6 sems. So your total tuition fees would work out to be around 24k + 4.92k (first sem) + 6.15k (second sem),
,
Not sure about other unis though, but you might want to check with the unis whether they have caps on subsidised fees. Goodluck!"

,As I’m currently left w 7 sems of TG, if I extend my studies by 1 year, there’ll be a deficit of 1 sem since I would be doing a total of 8 semesters. This additional sem  would not be covered by the TG. NTU will cap at 120% of subsidised school fee for the first sem. ,

Last 2 sems are default sems of your new course of study, however, you can only apply for TG once, and since you have already used up 2 sems, you are left with 6 sems of TG. Does not matter whether your new course of study is a 4 or 3 year course. TG would only cover you for another 6 semesters."

I'm spectulating that even though 'O' level scores will be removed in the calculation of the UAS (20% Os, 80% GPA) for diploma holders, there will still be subject prerequisites for NUS's SOC courses. ,

It might be good for you to take up extra math courses like TP's University Preparatory Programme in Math.,

		Didn't thought that it will be crucial for uni intake since the course I was interested didn't need it. Now there's limited option if I wanna choose another course.,
But nvm, its in the past. Next year onwards they are removing o lvl scores for poly grads anw.

I was just wondering if you could give me some comments on which university would suit my interest or passion better from your point of view or experiences.(As a guideline, I have applied for NTU Psych with 2nd major in bio science/ SMU SOSS/ NUS FASS),
,
Facts about myself:,
1. I grew fondly for social science (i.e. psychology) even though I am a poly student who studies accountancy and have a mixture of accounting and business knowledge.,
,
2. I feel that I want to study with a deeper meaning and that it would benefit both society and myself. (I love to make people smile and be happy, thinking on the positive side),
,
3. I would not only just basically want to study on psychology, I want to expand my knowledge such as taking extra courses that would broaden my career prospects.,
,
The above facts are there to briefly describe what are my thoughts now because I do not want to regret choosing the wrong course in the end but still I'm planning to enter a local uni as of now. I would really appreciate any feedbacks or suggestions from any point of view. ,
,
Thanks guys! ,
	,
,Hey there! I'm currently in NTU social sciences. ,
1. For NTU, unlike SMU SOSS or NUS FASS, we don't go through those introductory courses and you don't pick your specialization after  year 1. You directly get into your course in NTU and get modules specifically (i.e. psychology) based. ,
This is a one of the advantage of being in NTU whereas, i heard sometimes if you want a specific course (i.e. psych) , you have to ""fight"" for it. The more popular the course, the harder to get in. Oh, btw most poly graduates are exempted from several GERPEs. (Modules that you are required to take ranging from sciences, business, liberal arts, etc.) ,
,
2. You can look into sociology too? This degree is about the society and people. (You can DM me about sociology cause I'm in this course , ) ,
,
3. You can always take a minor in ntu."

I saw someone saying that you'll have a huge culture shock if you went ntu compared to smu. I personally don't think so. I was from poly too, and I didn't feel that it was really difficult to adapt. It's like poly but harder , . The classes are simply lectures, tutorials, seminars. If im not wrong, both uni place heavy emphasis on speaking up in classes or else, you'll get marked down. ,
I find it easy? to adapt and usually i take some time to adapt to a new environment. The first week is usually the hardest."

Actually it’s not v  true that you have to ‘fight’ to major in e.g psych in nus. It’s just that there are some prerequisites - one must get at least B- in psych intro and stats mod. Personally I feel that this is quite fair, as it tests you to see if you can adapt to psych, coz some ppl regret majoring in psych but have no way out alr (maybe coz it’s not what it really seems). ,
,
For me I’m quite grateful for FASS system that makes us go through diff intro mods before specialising in one major. I used to want to do sociology, but after taking both intro mods, I realised that psychology is better suited for me. I think for your case, since you have no foundation in psych in poly, maybe you can try consider nus to see if psych is really what you want! (But of course it’s just a suggestion! ,)"

Not too sure about NTU courses, but i do know NUS FASS offers you a wide array of courses to take outside of psychology. Besides, you can choose to specialise after year 1. You may want to give yourself that 1 year to explore the introductory courses from different departments and speak to seniors to get a feel of how they're doing.,
,
With regards to your point 2, have you looked into NUS Social Work? I have friends who are graduates from that field and they have plenty of opportunities to make people smile and be happy , although i must say that it can be quite demanding because your clients can be quite difficult to manage.,

	,
,Hi there! I could only give you general insights (not only applied in uni) on how both courses differentiate against each other. Basically for accountancy, it is a more specific field where students get to learn how to craft out financial statements, do budgets and analyze certain accounting figures to assist management in decision-making through a course in management accounting. You would receive knowledge on auditing and taxation as well. Hence, you would eventually gain career prospects to the Big 4 firms and self-source accounting firms (SMEs) etc.,
,
However, for finance in business, it is more of learning about stocks exchange, investments, financial tools to hedging etc. It is more about receiving knowledge on both the banking and broker sides. I can't address too much about this but I could only say that finance would lead to to possible career options such as investment banker and stock broker etc. At the end of the day, finance and accountancy both have their own specific skills which would lead to a myriad of job opportunities as companies would want to hire graduates who attain some knowledge on the financing and accounting sectors. Of course, that being said, you will still have to learn some basic business knowledge on both sides since its a core element that is imparted to students.,
,
Hope this would help you have a better insight on both differences as I could only give you general comments on this. "

,Consider this. Smu is a 4 year course and the fees they charge are 11k+.  U can simply take LoA for internships in NTU if u do not want to grad in 3 yrs.  ,
,
If you're heading to big 4 after grad, heard the starting pay is more or less the same. If so, why go for a 4 year's course? ,
,
Ntu offers plenty of exchange opportunities too. ,
,
This is my personal opinion but I think poly kids are able to cope better if they go to smu rather than NUS or NTU.  ,
,
You will definitely get a shock when you enter ntu. You would have to put in effort from week 1 if you want to maintain your gpa. In my first sem, majority of my classmates are from mid tier to top jcs (anderson, hwachong, raffles, acjc and etc). Their rank points are about 85 to 90. As such it is VERY VERY difficult to compete with them. Not sure about SMU."

Dragons have a warm heart and that makes their “fire” palatable. ,

Frankly, I'm mostly worried about the state of this year's cohort (dragon babies and all) - I'm slightly below my school's median RP as well, so I can't help but feel like I'm at more risk than the IGP would indicate. Hopefully the first choice bonus will help though."

		Consider this. Smu is a 4 year course and the fees they charge are 11k+.  U can simply take LoA for internships in NTU if u do not want to grad in 3 yrs.  ,
,
If you're heading to big 4 after grad, heard the starting pay is more or less the same. If so, why go for a 4 year's course? ,
,
Ntu offers plenty of exchange opportunities too. ,
,
This is my personal opinion but I think poly kids are able to cope better if they go to smu rather than NUS or NTU.  ,
,
You will definitely get a shock when you enter ntu. You would have to put in effort from week 1 if you want to maintain your gpa. In my first sem, majority of my classmates are from mid tier to top jcs (anderson, hwachong, raffles, acjc and etc). Their rank points are about 85 to 90. As such it is VERY VERY difficult to compete with them. Not sure about SMU.

,actually for poly grads going uni & intend to go big4, better to go SIT. can become Associate 2 upon graduation and it is 2-3 years course.,

but if want big 3 then NTU because 3 years course. Good Internships usually require self source,

,Hii, ,
Based on what i know, SMU SOSS that are quite strict with their IGP. This year is 3.70 and your gpa doesn't meet it. But through DA, maybe! But there might be a chance!,
,
NTU psych, there's a slight chance but if you fail to get it on the first round, try appealing! It might work.  ,
NUS, your o level is good so there might be a chance. I know people around your GPA gotten in FASS."

	,
,For NUS, the sections for the da is not marked as compulsory (*). You can just fill up if u have the relevant achievements. So, da is also in the same application as the normal one.,
,
For NTU, you have to go another link to submit the da too. So you have to submit the normal + da.,
,
Basically, can just go ahead and try DA,  Ultimately, they still look at your results."

Hi,,
,
,
His mark is too low so the chance is slim. Can try discretionary admission though but just the MO testimony alone might be a bit insufficient. Will need some exceptional ""qualities"", ""CCA"", ""volunteering"" and of course a good interview with NUS to get him admitted for the program. ,
,
,
,
So your son may need to work hard now to get some ""exceptional"" stuffs to get shortlisted"". Anyway, no harm applying! Good luck!"

Both programs stand out in different ways and I will be really grateful for any input from current students/alumni!

,Was there a separate application for NUS scholarship? I don't remember there was. If you qualify for NUS scholarship they will email you for interview.,

NTU REP is easier to get than NUS GMS / MS, i would say much easier. As NTU REP is specific to the engineering program, naturally you have to apply for it. But NUS GMS/MS is across all faculties. Previously they was no separate application. Maybe it is different now? idk.,

USP is not a scholarship . It is just a program."

Min criteria for GP is not C and D respectively. It’s just that if you score worse than that, you have to undergo an English test after u enrol in the Uni (e.g QET in NUS). I think you can try NUS/NTU, no harm trying "

Do you have any insights regarding InfoSec and InfoSys, or even NUS CS? Depending on whether their cutoff RP rises/drops, I have to put my first choice carefully. InfoSys seems like a safer choice but it is one of the few courses that rose in requirement in 2018, as contrary to falling requirements. Not sure if that trend will continue. Anyway, is the COP for this year likely higher or lower than last year? Last year fell like crazy esp. the engineering courses lol"

		Thanks for the advice! Since NTU ain't giving additional 1.25 RP for first choices I guess I may as well still put it in the first place lol,

		Hi, im a graduating poly student and had recently applied for ntu using 5 sem results.

If we require more information from you, we will contact you via email or your contact number.”,

Why don’t i have to submit any documents?? All my friend have a link provided for them to submit their 5 sem results.,

Not sure if I should just give it a go. I would say I have a pretty good portfolio but dk if I want to risk my first choice
	,
,Hihi, maybe you wanna try applying to SUTD too? I understand that the Engineering Systems & Design (ESD) and Information Systems Technology & Design (ISTD) course offers Biz Analytics. As you like the course curriculum of NUS Biz Analytics, the SUTD ISTD Biz Analytics course is directly in line with your interest. Computing is involved as there are machine learning and data analytics core module called “The Analytics Edge” that you can take from the ESD pillar as well if you select the SUTD ISTD Biz Analytics course. ,
,
SUTD open house is from 23-24 Feb, maybe you can attend to find out more about the courses? I went last year and it was great! The faculty and students were there to answer all my burning questions.,

Hope this helps! "

"Hey a diploma accountancy student here. A Maths is not a pre requisite for entry into accountancy course for local uni. I myself do not have A Level and have gotten accepted into NTU/SMU/NUS. But you will have to do bridging courses when you matriculate!,

If your forecast gpa is 3.5, i would advice you place your bet with SMU DA. Try to increase your chance with accounting/finance related competition. It will boast your chance especially if you managed to get top 3. ,

		Congrats! I received an invitation too! I was from JC, so I was wondering if the discovery day means you'll get into SMU no matter what your final a level grades are or is there a minimum requirement you have to score to get it?
	,
,you will receive your offer letter on the early admissions discovery day. you have to attend it though, because people who're invited for it normally won't need to go for an interview."

If SMU sent you an invitation for early admission, you'll receive offers for interviews by mid Jan (they said to apply by 13th Jan to be considered under early admissions, so I'm guessing interview offers would come after 13th Jan.),

,I think there's chance for FASS. NUS Biz, I don't think the possibility is high. and if next year, they don't take into consideration of O levels, chances might differ"

		Are you from BCG? Care to share your experience?

,It is what it says, double degree... 20 - 23 au cores every semester (26 au if you plan to add a minor),
,
About double the number of finals also... so yeah it's insane to prep for finals within 1 or 2 days. Academically quite challenging you will learn (self-learn) quite alot of interesting content.,
,
Lots of smart people in there too.. personally for myself I learnt alot from them as well. Learning how to study smartly to free yourself up for other commitments.,

,NUS  3.66 3.95 (342 slots),
NTU	3.61 3.94 (532 slots),
,
Probably can get into NTU, considering they have more slots and historically lower IGP."

,Your score would be nearly guaranteed entry to NTU Mech Eng if they don't lower the intake for 2019. I know people there who had 3.6 and no cca achievements back in poly."

,Chance is 50-50. Don't worry, aeronautical engineering can take CEG, just that no module exemptions so you have to do 4 years.,
,
Also depends if you're applying as a mature candidate or not. If you're not applying as a mature candidate, since the IGP for CEG is 3.74, you're very borderline. If you're applying as a mature candidate, NUS will disregard your diploma results and use SAT results. So you'd have to take SAT if you want to enter as a mature candidate, but it also depends on how well you can do for SAT."
